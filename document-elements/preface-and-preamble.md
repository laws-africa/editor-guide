# Preface, Long title, and Preamble

The Preface and Preamble are optional components that come at the start of a piece of legislation, before the main body.

The Preface, if present, always comes before the Preamble.

## How to add a Preface

1. Enter Edit mode.
2. Put the keyword `PREFACE` on a line on its own, before anything else.
3. Place the content of the Preface after the keyword.
4. If there is a Long title, include it in the Preface using the keyword `LONGTITLE`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Preface will appear in the Table of Contents on the left, but it won't have a heading in the document itself. 
{% endhint %}

### Example

```text
PREFACE

LONGTITLE To make provision for procedures and related matters in criminal proceedings.

Under the provisions of the Constitution, Parliament makes the following law:—
```

## How to add a Preamble

1. Enter Edit mode.
2. Put the keyword `PREAMBLE` on a line on its own, before `BODY` \(and after the end of the Preface, if there is one\).
3. Place the content of the Preamble after the keyword.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Preamble will appear in the Table of Contents on the left. In some countries, it will also show up as a heading in the document.
{% endhint %}

### Example

```text
PREFACE

LONGTITLE To provide a set of regulations governing the use of land and buildings for outdoor advertising and signage and for matters incidental thereto.

PREAMBLE

WHEREAS everyone has the constitutional right to an environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being;

BE IT ENACTED by the Council of the City of Cape Town as follows:—
```

## The enactment clause

The enactment clause usually starts with the phrase "Be it enacted . . . " 

If there is a Preamble, this clause will be at the end of the Preamble before the Body.

If there is no Preamble, this clause will be at the end of the Preface after the Longtitle.

## Exercise

1. Copy and paste the text below into a blank document in your editor.
2. Click **Update**. Note that the text is correct, but the Table of contents on the left-hand side does not include a Preface or a Preamble, and the Long title is not bold.
3. Click **Edit** and fix the ordering and the markup so that the Preface comes first, including the Long title, then the Preamble, and then the main body, as in the screenshots below.

```text
BODY
