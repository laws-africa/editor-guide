# Annexures

Some Acts and regulations have Annexures, which come at the end of the main body of the work. They are separate from the main content and have separate headings.

An Annexure has a heading, such as 'Annexure 1' or sometimes just 'Annexure'. Some Annexures also have subheadings, such as 'Notification of opening of hostel'.

## How to structure an Annexure

1. Introduce the Annexure with `SCHEDULE`.
2. Put the Annexure heading on the next line using the `HEADING` keyword.
3. If the Annexure has a subheading, put it after the heading line, using the `SUBHEADING` keyword.
4. If there is a further heading \(often containing section references\), put it after the subheading line using the `CROSSHEADING`keyword.

### Example

```text
SCHEDULE
HEADING Annexure A1
SUBHEADING Application for exemption 
CROSSHEADING (Application in terms of section 6)
```

For further instructions on structuring Annexures, see 'Schedules' as the structuring is the same.
