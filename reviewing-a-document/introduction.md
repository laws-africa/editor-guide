# Reviewing a document

## Guiding principles

When you review someone else's work, your goals are to:

* catch errors that weren't spotted by the first editor
* provide constructive feedback to the first editor
* make note of other changes that may still need to be done
* publish the content.

## How to review a document

1. Assign an 'Import content' task that has been submitted for review to yourself.
2. Follow the link on the task to the work overview page.
3. Open the imported document.
4. Click **Show source** to see the imported PDF.
   * If a Word document was imported and there's no gazette to compare against, click **Attachments** and download it.
5. Compare the document against the imported file.
6. Note any changes to be made on the document using comments.
7. If the first editor needs to make changes before the document can be published, click **Request changes** on the task. You can add a general comment at the same time.
8. If the document is ready to be published, link the defined terms again, click **Save & publish** on the document \(drop-down next to **Save draft**\), and click **Approve** on the task.
9. If for some reason the document has already been published but changes still need to be made to it, click **Unpublish & save** on the document \(drop-down next to **Save & publish**\) before requesting changes. \(Only reviewers can make changes to published documents.\)

The most important part of the process is where you click **Save & publish**, don't forget this crucial step!

### Tips

* Use comments on the document to provide feedback about individual issues.
* Use comments on the task to provide more general advice.
* Make new tasks to record other changes that still need to be done, such as linking amendments or a commencing work.
* If a document is almost ready to be published and there are only a few small changes, you can make the changes yourself and leave a comment on the task to let the first editor know what change you made, so that they know for next time.
