# Reviewing a document

## Guiding principles

When you review someone else's work, your goals are to:

* catch errors that weren't spotted by the first editor
* provide constructive feedback to the first editor to help them improve
* make note of other changes that may still need to be done
* publish the content.

## How to review a document

1. Assign an 'Import content' task to yourself.
2. Follow the link on the task to the work overview page.
3. Open the imported document.
4. Find the imported file under 'Attachments' and click on it. It will open in a separate window.
5. Compare the document against the imported file.
6. Note any changes to be made on the document using comments.
7. If the first editor needs to make changes before the document can be published,  'Request changes' on the task.
8. If the document is ready to be published, 'Save and send for publishing' and 'Approve' the task.

## Tips

* Use comments on the document to provide feedback about individual issues.
* Use comments on the task to provide more general advice.
* Make new tasks to record other changes that still need to be done, such as linking amendments or a commencing work.
* If a document is almost ready to be published and there are only a few small changes, you can make the changes yourself and leave a comment on the task to let the first editor know what change you made, so that they know for next time.
