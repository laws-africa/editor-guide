# Reviewer checklist

### Macro structure / issues

* [ ] Table of Contents: numbers follow
* [ ] `PREFACE`, `LONGTITLE`, `PREAMBLE`, `BODY` used as and where appropriate
* [ ] Commencement date/s captured
* [ ] Schedules: headings / subheadings / section references marked up correctly
* [ ] Headings are [Sentence case](../style-guides/laws.africa.md#headings)
* [ ] Defined terms captured
* [ ] References linked correctly \(specifically, no references linked incorrectly\)
* [ ] Terms italicised correctly
* [ ] Editor warnings all resolved

### Keywords

* [ ] Heading keywords used appropriately \(e.g. `Part`, not `CROSSHEADING Part`\)
* [ ] Formatting \(`//` for italics and `**` for bold\) not overused, e.g. not used for crossheadings
* [ ] Table heading style used rather than manually bolding text
* [ ] Superscripts \(`12^^th^^`\) and subscripts \(`CO_^2^_`\) captured

### Structure

* [ ] Subsection, paragraph, etc. numbers follow
* [ ] Annotations indented correctly
* [ ] Text at end of nested lists indented correctly
* [ ] Line breaks – text that was pulled back into section heading
* [ ] Line breaks – heading that ran over a line
* [ ] Line breaks – body text that was incorrectly broken up

### OCR issues

Check for these by skimming the text and searching for repeated occurrences of any errors.

* [ ] \(1\) accidentally recorded as lowercase \(L\) or uppercase \(i\) \(there should be an editor warning for this\)
* [ ] Words joined together, e.g. `of the` recorded as `ofthe`
* [ ] Ligatures misrecognised, e.g. `ri` recorded as `n`
* [ ] Numbers picked up incorrectly \(e.g. SO,OOO instead of 50,000\)
* [ ] Currency symbols misrecognised \(e.g. N instead of ₦\)
