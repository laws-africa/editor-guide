An **Expression** is a particular version of a work, in a specific language and at a particular point in time. A Work may have many expressions associated with it.

An **Amending Work** is an Act or other legislation that makes changes to another work \(the **Principal Work**\). Amending works are published when government needs to update or change an existing piece of legislation.
