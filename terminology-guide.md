![The terminology of Laws.Africa.](.gitbook/assets/laws.africa-terminology.png)

A **Work** is the logical concept of an Act or other piece of legislation. A Work may change over time through amendments or be issued in multiple languages.

An **Expression** is a particular version of a work, in a specific language and at a particular point in time. A Work may have many expressions associated with it.

An **Amending Work** is an Act or other legislation that makes changes to another work \(the **Principal Work**\). Amending works are published when government needs to update or change an existing piece of legislation.

A **Commencing Work** is normally a notice, but can also be another Act, that provides the Commencement date for a Principal Work.

**Amendments** are the changes that are applied to a Work by an **Amending Work**. They are instructions of insertions and deletions that must be made to the text of the Work being amended.

A **Point in Time** is all the Expressions of a Work on a particular date. There is usually only one Expression at a particular date, unless the Work is available in multiple languages. Often, a Point in Time is synonymous with an Expression.

**Subsidiary legislation** are regulations, statutory instruments and orders which are related to a primary Act.

### Dates

**Assent**: The date on which the work is approved by the relevant authority.

**Publication**: Usually in the Gazette.

**Commencement**: The date on which a work comes into force. If nothing is specified, it is often the publication date; to double-check, read the Interpretation Act of the country in which you’re working.   
Amendments to Principal Works come into force on the Commencement date of the Amending Work.
