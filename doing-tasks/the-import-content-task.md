4. On the work overview page, click **Manage points in time**.
5. At the initial publication date, click **Import document**.
6. On the new page, choose a language.
7. Choose the file you downloaded in Step 1.
8. Choose the pages to import: 
   * Skip the gazette cover page and contents pages, as well as pages containing other legislation or notices.
   * Make sure you don't skip the start or end of the relevant legislation \(especially the end\).
9. Drag the corners of the blue box to exclude running headers and footers \(but don't exclude any text\).
10. To determine what the section titles look like, scroll sideways until you find a section heading, and choose from the options given at the bottom.
11. Go for it!
12. Once imported, the document will open and will be ready for [clean-up](../editing-a-document/cleaning-up-an-import.md).
13. When you are done cleaning up the imported document, return to the task and click **Submit for review**.
14. The content will be reviewed by a second editor. They may return it to you for changes or approve the task and publish the document â€“ you will get an email notification either way.
