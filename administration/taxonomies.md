# Taxonomies

Taxonomies are used to group works into collections. The platform supports multiple taxonomies and a work can belong to or any number of taxonomies.

## About taxonomies

A taxonomy is a collection of labels called **topics**. A topic can have one or two levels, forming a shallow hierarchy.&#x20;

A taxonomy has these properties:

* Title: the descriptive title of the taxonomy
* Authority: the organisation that is responsible for this Taxonomy
* Name: the short name for the taxonomy, based on the title
* Slug: a code name for the taxonomy used in the API. This is generated automatically from the authority and the name.
* Topics: topics with a level 1 name, and (optionally) a level 2 name

For example, here is a small two-level subject area taxonomy called 'Legislative Subject Areas':

* Title: Legislative Subject Areas (title)
* Topics:
  * Level 1: Money and Business (level 1)
    * Level 2: Contracts
    * Level 2: Taxation
  * Level 1: People and Work
    * Level 2: Employment
    * Level 2: Health
