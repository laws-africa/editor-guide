### Italics terms

Some countries have specific terms which are always _italicised_ in their legal tradition. For example, in South Africa, latin terms such as _pro rata_ and _in situ_ are always italicised. The platform can be configured to do this italicisation automatically.

5. Click **Save**

### Publications

Publications are the names of the publications that are presented to a user when they are creating or editing a Work. It is useful to enter common publication names to save the user from having to type them.

To edit the publications for a country or add a new one:

1. Open the admin interface
2. Under **Indigo API** click **Countries**
3. Click on the name of the country you wish to edit
4. Add or edit publications
5. To delete an existing publication, check the **Delete** checkbox
6. Click **Save**

## Localities

Localities are places such as provinces, counties or municipalities that are within a country. Localities have their own tasks and workflows.

All localities must have a unique code within the country. This code is combined with the country code to generate a _place code_, which is used in the FRBR URI for the works in that locality.

For example, in South Africa, the municipality of Cape Town has the official  code of `cpt`, which is given by the Municipal Demarcation Board. Combined with the code for South Africa, the full place code for  Cape Town, South Africa is `za-cpt`.

Use official locality codes wherever possible. These might come from your government or from the International Standards Organisation \(IOS
