# Search and rescue

When cleaning up an import, depending on the quality of the scan / consolidation you're working with, you may find things that are consistently wrong. Using Search to find all the instances of a mistake will help you to ensure the quality of the content without having to remember to check each section for the same error.

## How to find the space that's missing after punctuation

1. Enter Edit mode in the section that has the 'space missing after punctuation' warning.
2. Click **Edit** and then **Find**.
3. Select the first (`.*`) option above the Search bar.
4. Type `[.:,)]\w` into the Search bar: this will look for any one of the punctuations listed between the square brackets followed by any of a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or \_ (`\w` is a shorthand for this). It will take you to the first instance, if there is one.
5. Manually insert a space after the punctuation, assuming it should be inserted.
6. Hit Enter in the Search bar again to go to the next instance, if there is one.
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 as needed.

## How to find all instances of 'N' instead of '₦'

1. With the Entire document selected, enter Edit mode.
2. Click **Edit** and then **Find**.
3. Select the first (`.*`) and second (`Aa`) options above the Search bar.
4. Type `N ?\d` into the Search bar: this will look for capital N followed by any number (0-9), with an optional space between. It will take you to the first instance, if there is one.
5. Manually replace the N with ₦.
6. Hit Enter in the Search bar again to go to the next instance.
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 until all instances have been fixed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't use 'Edit | Find next' while `N1` is highlighted – this will only find the next instance of `N1` in the example above, rather than using the regular expression `N ?\d`.
{% endhint %}

### Exercise

1. Copy and paste the text below into the editor.
2. Use the instructions given above to fix all instances of N being used instead of ₦.
