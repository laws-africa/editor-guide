# Marking up formatting

In general, we don't mark up bold, italics, or underlined text purely for emphasis.

Words or phrases that should be bold because they are headings or defined terms should rather be marked up as headings or defined terms.

But some terms are italicised, depending on the jurisdiction (see [Working with italicised terms](italicised-terms.md)), and sometimes other formatting should be applied, such as superscript or subscript.

### Superscript

```
The 2^^nd^^ one
```

### Subscript

```
The CO_^2^_ levels
```

### Italics

```
The //bona fide// attempt
```

### Bold

```
The **exceptional** circumstance
```

### Underline

```
The __very rare__ need to underline
```
