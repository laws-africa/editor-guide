# Going back to a previous version of a document

Every now and then, a mistake is introduced into a document and we need to return to a previous version of it. This page describes how to do that.

{% hint style="info" %}
Pro tip:

If you're busy editing and something goes horribly wrong when you hit Update, just refresh the page to return to the last saved version of the document.&#x20;

Any other unsaved changes will also be lost — another reason to save often 😉
{% endhint %}

If you have already saved and want to return to a previously saved version of a document:

1. Open the 'Changes' panel.
2. Select the version you want to return to.&#x20;
   * Note: The changes shown for each version are the differences between the previous saved version and that one.
3. Click 'Restore this version' and confirm.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Any unsaved changes, as well as any changes saved after the version you are restoring to, will be discarded.
{% endhint %}
