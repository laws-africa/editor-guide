# Inserting an image

1. Take a partial screenshot of the image you want to insert \(search online for how best to do this in your operating system\).
2. Save or rename the file as something useful, e.g. 'logo' or 'map'.
3. In a document, enter Edit mode and click 'Insert \| Insert image …'.
4. In the popup, click **Choose a file** and select your screenshot.
5. Once it has uploaded, select it and click **Insert image**.
6. In Edit mode, only some text will appear but if you click **Update**, you should see your image.
