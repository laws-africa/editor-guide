# Tasks

## Finding tasks

1. In the navigation bar at the top of each page in the platform, click **Tasks**.
2. You will be taken to the 'My tasks' tab, which lists:
   * Your current tasks (tasks that have been assigned to you that you haven't submitted yet),
   * Tasks waiting for approval (tasks that you have submitted), and
   * Your recently approved tasks (tasks that you have successfully completed in the past while).
3. Click **Priority tasks** to see all the tasks that are in Projects that have been prioritised.
4. Click **All available tasks** to see all the tasks that are available.
5. Filter these tasks lists by:&#x20;
   * Their state (Open or Pending review),
   * Their type (start with 'Import content' tasks), and/or
   * Their country.

## Doing tasks

Once you have found a task:

1. Click on the task title (e.g. 'Import content') to go to that task's page.
2. Assign the task to yourself by clicking **Assign to** and choosing your name from the dropdown.
3. Read the instructions.
   * For 'Import content' tasks follow the instructions at [Importing a document](importing-a-document.md).
   * For 'Apply amendment' tasks follow the instructions at [Amending works](../managing-works/amending-works/).
4. Once you have completed the task, click **Submit for review**. The content will be reviewed by a second editor. They may return it to you for changes or approve the task and publish the document â€“ you will get an email notification either way.

## Creating a task from a comment

One of the most common ways of creating a task to create it from a comment on a document.

1. **Make a comment** by selecting some text and clicking the speech bubble on the right-hand side of the page, writing the comment, and clicking 'Comment'.
2. **Create a task** by selecting 'Create task' from the drop-down in the top-right corner of the comment.

The task itself will have a preview of the part of the document where the comment was made.
