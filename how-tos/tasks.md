# Tasks

## Finding tasks

2. You will be taken to the 'My tasks' tab, which lists:
   * Your current tasks \(tasks that have been assigned to you that you haven't submitted yet\),
   * Tasks waiting for approval \(tasks that you have submitted\), and
   * Your recently approved tasks \(tasks that you have successfully completed in the past while\).
3. Click **Priority tasks** to see all the tasks that are in Projects that have been prioritised.
4. Click **All available tasks** to see all the tasks that are available.

## Doing tasks

Once you have found a task:

1. Click on the task title \(e.g. 'Import content'\) to go to that task's page.
2. Assign the task to yourself by clicking **Assign to** and choosing your name from the dropdown.
3. Read the instructions.
   * For 'Import content' tasks follow the instructions at [Importing a document](importing-a-document.md).
   * For 'Apply amendment' tasks follow the instructions at [Amending works](../managing-works/amending-works/).
4. Once you have completed the task, click **Submit for review**. The content will be reviewed by a second editor. They may return it to you for changes or approve the task and publish the document â€“ you will get an email notification either way.
