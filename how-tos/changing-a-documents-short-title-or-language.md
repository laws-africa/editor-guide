# Changing a document's short title or language

Usually, a document on a work shares the work's short title.

But some documents won't share the work's title, for example if a document is in a different language from the primary language, or the work's short title has been amended over time.

To change the document's short title and/or language:

* Open the document (View mode).
* Click 'Settings | Propertiesâ€¦'.
* Under 'Short title', update the short title for the document.
* Under 'Language', select the right language for the document.
* Close the pop-up. Note that the work's short title is unchanged, while the document's title has been updated.
* Save.
