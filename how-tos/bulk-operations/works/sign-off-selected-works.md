# Sign off selected works

You can't sign off changes to a work's content in bulk, only changes to its metadata, like the title or timeline.

The changes to a group of selected works is grouped by attribute. In the screenshot below, the selected works all only have changes to their titles, so there's only one attribute listed: Work title.

When you select an attribute to sign off and click **Sign off**, all the selected works will have their change to that attribute signed off, so proceed with caution. All the changes you're about to sign off are listed, so do check them.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you **don't** want to sign off the title (for example) change to a work, de-select it or use the filters to exclude it from the group, and click 'Sign off X selected â€¦' again.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Calculating all the changes takes time and processing power, so don't select all works just to see what happens :pray:
{% endhint %}
