# Approve or unapprove selected works

### Approve selected works

Approving works in bulk removes `work in progress` from each of the selected works, and creates the relevant tasks on each of them. It gives you the chance to edit the task descriptions, too.

{% hint style="info" %}
Approving a work also signs it off as a stub in the background.
{% endhint %}

In general, you shouldn't do anything other than the default behaviour ('Create tasks'), and let the system do its thing. It will show potential duplicate amendment tasks in the form though, and you can elect not to create those tasks. (Do read them carefully though! Maybe there should be two or more amendment tasks at the same date.)

The more works you select and the more complex they are (e.g. multiple amendments), the longer the form might take to render.

{% hint style="info" %}
Works can't be approved if they don't have at least a 'project' taxonomy topic.
{% endhint %}

### Unapprove selected works

Unapproving is the more straightforward of the two: it will simply mark all the works listed as `work in progress` and unpublish any documents on them.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Unpublishing the works will still need to be signed off.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't unapprove a whole bunch of works as a 'quick fix', since re-publishing all the documents can't be done in bulk, and each work could have many documents :sweat\_smile:
