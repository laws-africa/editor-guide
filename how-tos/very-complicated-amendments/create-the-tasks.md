# Create the tasks

Create an 'Apply amendment' task for each amendment by an amending Act at a given date.

{% hint style="info" %}
The tasks will be done in chronological order, and per date in order of Act number / year, so do keep the amendments by different Acts on separate tasks.
{% endhint %}

* Remember to include the date :)
* The description will show on the timeline, so keep it brief, e.g. 'Apply the amendments made by Act 17 of 2023 (7 sections)'. If it's only one provision being amended, you can include all the details in the description rather than as comments.
* As comments on the task, for each provision amended per task, include from the spreadsheet:
  * The amending provision
  * The amended provision
  * The PDF page number of the amending provision
  * The commencement wording.
* Block each task as you create it.
* Paste a link to each task in the spreadsheet. If multiple provisions are amended by the same Act at the same date, remember to paste the link at each row.

{% hint style="info" %}
For amendments that don't yet have a date, create a separate task for each provision as described above and add the `Pending commencement` label.
{% endhint %}

At the end of this process, each amendment on the timeline (and each pending amendment) should have an associated task, and the spreadsheet should have a link to a task for each amended provision.
