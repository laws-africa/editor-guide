# Update the timeline

Update the timeline of the amended work.&#x20;

Several people _can_ do this asynchronously, but it's one of the easier steps so we suggest that one person does it in one go.

Researcher 1:

* Add an amendment at each date on which each amending Act amends the principal Act.
* This can mean several amendments per amending Act, and it can also mean multiple amendments on the same date by different Acts.
* Also add amendments for each amended amendment.
* Record each addition in the spreadsheet as you go — use 'x' or 'Yes' or something other than ✔ to show that it's ready for review.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's probably quicker and easier to add amendments from each amending Act than to edit the principal Act.
{% endhint %}

Researcher 2:

* Check the timeline on the principal Act, bearing in mind:
  * Everything that has been marked as ready for review on the spreadsheet (update to ✔ once checked)
  * Any amendments that should have been removed as part of the previous step
  * All other amended amendments.
* If anything is missing or incorrect, make a comment in the spreadsheet and finish checking everything before making any changes.
* Approve or sign off all (changes to) the amending Acts.
* Sign off the timeline changes to the principal work.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use bulk sign-off to sign off only the timeline changes.
{% endhint %}

At the end of this process, the timeline of the principal Act as well as any amended amendment Acts should be correct, and the spreadsheet should have a check mark under 'on timeline ✔' for each row (other than those that don't yet have a commencement date).
