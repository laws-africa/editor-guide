# Apply the amendments

Editor:

* Unblock and assign the earliest task:
  * At the earliest date (do check all the way down the timeline)
  * The first amending Act year, e.g. do all 2019 amendments before starting 2020 ones
  * The first amending Act number, e.g. do Act 17 of 2023 before Act 18 of 2023.
* If a document doesn't yet exist at the given date, create one as usual.
* Edit the document in provision mode — use the instructions on the task for guidance on which provision to edit, and which amending provision on which page of the amending PDF to look at.
* Include the effective date and the commencement wording in the annotation — look around for examples, there are many.
* Once each individual amendment described in the task has been applied, submit the task as usual.

Reviewer:

* Review the task as usual, using the individual amendments described in the task for guidance. Only and all those amendments should have been applied.
* If there are more amendments to be applied at the given date, do not publish and sign off the document yet, but rather unblock the next amendment task.
* Once all amendments have been applied at a date, publish and sign off the document as usual.
