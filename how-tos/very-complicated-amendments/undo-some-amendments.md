# Undo some amendments?

This will only apply to amended amendments, and should hopefully be fairly rare.

1. If the commencement date of an amendment has been moved out to the next year (or some other specified or unspecified time in the future) but it was already applied at its old commencement date, make a task to un-apply the amendment and re-apply it at the new date.
2. If the given point in time was already published, unpublish it and all subsequent points in time.
3. Record the wording as it was after the change in the task description, or as a comment on the task, for copy / pasting. \
   If it's a large provision or many amendments, make a copy of the point in time before unapplying the amendments, and make a comment at each provision to be preserved / integrated.
4. Include the updated annotation in the task too, or at least all the information needed to update the annotation.
5. If all the amendments at a given date by a given Act were moved to a new date, remove the amendment event from the timeline as well. This can prove pretty tricky when there are multiple amendments at the same date, so please reach out for help at this stage. \
   Here though are the steps for removing an amendment at a given date when there are other amendments by other Acts at that date:
   * Change the date of the amendment to be deleted to the day before or after — there should be nothing else on that date. The document will move with it, but all the other amendments will remain at the correct date.
   * Open the document and change its date back to the correct date.
   * Now the amendment should be alone on the timeline and can be deleted.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do all of this in one sitting per amendment to be deleted — figuring out how far along in the process you were and remembering what is supposed to be deleted and what the correct date was can take much longer than just doing it.

If you don't have an hour, don't start this step :pray:.
