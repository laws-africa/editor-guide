# Inserting editorial notes

Where there is a very obvious error in numbering in the original Gazette, as well as making a comment in the margin please also insert an editorial note in the actual document, like this:

(1) blah blah blah\
&#x20;    (a) blah blah\
&#x20;    (b) blah blah\
&#x20;    (d) blah blah\
&#x20;    _\[Please note: numbering as in original.]_\
_     _(e) blah blah

or

1\. blah blah\
2\. blah blah\
3\. blah blah\
3\. blah blah\
_\[Please note: numbering as in original.]_\
4\. blah blah

As you can see,  the note goes directly under where the error occurs.
