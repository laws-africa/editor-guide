# Changing a document's title

Usually, a document (or point in time) on a work shares the work's title.

But if a document is in a different language from the primary language, or the work's title was amended over time, some documents won't share the work's title.

* Open the document (View mode).
* Click 'Settings | Propertiesâ€¦'.
* Under 'Short title', update the title for the current document.
* Save.
