# Working with italicised terms

In some traditions, certain terms appear in _italics._ For example, Latin terms such as _bona fide_, _inter alia_ and _pro rata_. The platform can do this automatically for specific terms.

## Italicised terms for a country

## How to remove italics

To remove italics from a single term, delete the surrounding `//`s. For example, `This //text// shouldn't be italicised` → `This text shouldn't be italicised`.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Select `text` in the above example and hit Ctrl+I to remove the italics. Hitting Ctrl+I again will re-italicise it.
{% endhint %}

To remove italics from **all** italicised terms in the document:

1. Click **Analysis** and then **Italicised terms**.
2. Click **Remove italics**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't do this if you've painstakingly italicised instructions in forms like (_insert name here_), because those will be removed as well.
{% endhint %}
