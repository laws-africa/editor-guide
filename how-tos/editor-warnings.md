# Resolving editor warnings

## Steps

1. Check the Table of Contents on the the left-hand side for warnings.
2. Go to the provision to see where exactly the warning is coming from.
3. Edit the provision to resolve the warning; the warning will no longer be there after you Update.
4. Don't forget to save! :\)

## Tips

* _Do_ fix OCR errors and whitespace errors.
* _Don't_ fix spelling, grammar, punctuation, or numbering errors; rather [make a comment](making-comments.md) or [insert an editorial note](inserting-editorial-notes.md).

## Examples

### All-caps headings

Solution: Make the heading/s [Sentence case](../style-guides/laws.africa.md#headings).

### Empty body

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28171%29.png)

Solution: Remove the 'Schedule' introduction \(keyword, heading, and subheading\), and make sure the body of the document starts after the `BODY` keyword.

### Empty section

Potential solutions:

* Move the content of the section under the heading, if it's a section.
* Use the `PARA` keyword, if it's a numbered paragraph in a Schedule or Annexure.
* insert a `\` before the number so that it gets treated as normal text, if it's a numbered list in the main body.
* Delete the number and heading, if it's in the Arrangement of Sections from the original.

### Duplicate section numbers

Solution: Check the section numbers in the original. If that's how they are, [insert an editorial note](inserting-editorial-notes.md).

### Other duplicates

Solution: Check the numbers in the original. If that's how they are, [insert an editorial note](inserting-editorial-notes.md).

### Numbers don't follow

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28151%29.png)

Solution: 

* First check that the previous element wasn't sucked into the one before it \(in this example, see if subsection \(3\) is at the end of subsection \(2\)\).
* Check the numbers in the original. If that's how they are, [insert an editorial note](inserting-editorial-notes.md).

### Only one element

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28152%29.png)

Solution: 

* First check that the subsequent element wasn't sucked into this one \(in this example, see if subsection \(2\) is at the end of subsection \(1\)\).
* Check the numbers in the original. If that's how they are, [make a comment](making-comments.md) \('note: as in original'\).
  * This way, if someone else sees the document and the warning, they'll know you've already checked it.

### \(l\) or \(I\) instead of \(1\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28165%29.png)

Solution: These should usually be changed to \(1\). If in doubt, make a comment to ask for feedback from a reviewer.

### Broken word

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28170%29.png)

Solution: These should usually be joined into one word \('responsible' in this case\). If in doubt, make a comment to ask for feedback from a reviewer.

### Space before punctuation

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28177%29.png)

Solution: Find and remove the space. \(You may need to use the 'Search' function in Edit view to find it.\)

If there should be a space before punctuation for some reason, [make a comment](making-comments.md) explaining why it isn't an error.

### Space missing after punctuation

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28155%29.png)

Solution: Insert the missing space.

If there shouldn't be a space for some reason, [make a comment](making-comments.md) explaining why it isn't an error.

### Broken link

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28166%29.png)

Solution: See [Working with links](work-with-links.md).

### Image missing attachment

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28159%29.png)

Solution: Make sure the name for the file given in Edit view has a corresponding attachment on the document.

### m2

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28163%29.png)

Solution: Superscript the 2: `… be 300m2 and …` → `… be 300m^^2^^ and …`, or make a comment if it shouldn't be superscripted.
