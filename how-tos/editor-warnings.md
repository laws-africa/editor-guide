# Resolving editor warnings

1. Check the Table of Contents on the the left-hand side for warnings.
2. Go to the provision to see where exactly the warning is coming from.
3. Edit the provision to resolve the warning; the warning will no longer be there after you Update.
4. Don't forget to save! :\)

### Tips

* _Do_ fix OCR errors and whitespace errors.
* _Don't_ fix spelling, grammar, punctuation, or numbering errors; rather leave a comment starting with 'note:', e.g. 'note: numbering as in original'.
