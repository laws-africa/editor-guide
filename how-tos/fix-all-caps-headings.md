# Fixing all-caps headings

1. In View mode, click 'Analysis | Make headings Sentence case'.
2. Review and fix headings.
3. Don't forget Step 2.

### Tips

* Only run **Make headings Sentence case** when the headings are all-caps.
* Run it as a first step, then check individual headings and re-capitalise proper nouns and acronyms.
* Never run it as a last step.
* Quick-edit sections that need words re-capitalised by clicking the pencil next to the heading.
