  amendment that has already altered an original document is further modified by
  a later amendment.

# Amended amendments

## **How to Identify an amended amendment**

A description indicating this will be provided on the amendment task. Since it is straightforward, proceed with making the corrections.\

If an amendment appears twice in the principal Act’s timeline (i.e., it has two PITs), and all its provisions share the same commencement date, the second PIT may be a correction that has been made to the original amendment, only that there isn't a comment indicating so.\
\
To confirm this, open the amending work. You’ll see a PIT indicating that it has been amended (e.g., “Amended by Rules...”). Then, open the amendment work linked to that PIT and use its  PDF to apply the updated changes where required.\

**How the annotation should look**
----------------------------------

After making the correction, add a note like the following to the existing annotation:&#x20;

> <mark style="color:blue;">`(as corrected by Government Notice 841 of 2021)`</mark>

The final annotation should read:

> <mark style="color:blue;">`[section 3 substituted by section 25 of Government Notice 322 of 2020 (as corrected by Government Notice 841 of 2021)]`</mark>&#x20;

## **Correctional Amendment Commences Retrospectively**

“Commenced retrospectively” means that a provision or correction is considered to take effect from an earlier date, even if it was officially published or decided later.

If a correctional amendment commences retrospectively on the same date as the original amendment, effect the corrections at the original amendment date and update any other PITs that were completed after that date to reflect the corrections.

## **Repealed Amendment**

Sometimes, an Act _and all its amendments_ will be repealed together. You'll often see this in a table in a Schedule. If the principal Act is repealed at the same time as the amendment (or the whole amendment Act), you don't need to change anything about the amendments that were already applied.&#x20;

In rarer cases, a particular amendment will be repealed. These can be treated the same as amended amendments, except for that instead of updating the change, you undo it.&#x20;

If the repeal commences retrospectively, you can undo it at the date on which it should have happened (and at any later points in time). In this case, the text would be unchanged but you would have an annotation that looks something like this:

> <mark style="color:blue;">`[section 3 substituted by section 25 of Act 21 of 2020 (retroactively repealed by section 3 of Act 3 of 2021)]`</mark>&#x20;

If the repeal doesn't commence retrospectively, undo the change at the later date on which the repeal comes into force (and at any later points in time). In this case, we will have one or more points in time where the amendment was in effect, and then a later and subsequent points in time where the text goes back to how it was before, with an annotation that looks something like this:

> <mark style="color:blue;">`[section 3 substituted by section 25 of Act 21 of 2020 (subsequently repealed by section 3 of Act 3 of 2021)]`</mark>&#x20;

These things are not straightforward! Always double-check with a colleague, especially before going ahead and making a bunch of changes.
