# Making comments

Some typos, like a missing space after a comma, can be fixed without comment.

Others, like a misnumbered element, may not be changed by anyone other than the official source of the legislation. We leave these as is and [insert a note](inserting-editorial-notes.md).

For typos or grammar errors that have a likely correction, but we can't be completely sure without checking with the drafters of the legislation, we make a comment as follows:

1. Highlight the text.
2. Click on the comment bubble on the right \(it will only appear once text is selected\).
3. Make a comment and click **Comment**.

### Tips

You can reply to comments, create tasks from them, and if it's your own comment you can resolve or delete it.
