description: Inserting editorial note

# Untitled

Where there is a very obvious error in numbering in the original Gazette, as well as making a comment in the margin please also insert an editorial note in the actual document, like this:

\(1\) blah blah blah  
     \(a\) blah blah  
     \(b\) blah blah  
     \(d\) blah blah  
     _\[Please note: numbering as in original.\]_  
     \(e\) blah blah

or

1. blah blah  
2. blah blah  
3. blah blah  
3. blah blah  
_\[Please note: numbering as in original.\]_  
4. blah blah

As you can see,  the note goes directly under where the error occurs.
