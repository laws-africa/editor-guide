# Indenting lists

1. Enter Edit mode.
2. At the start of a line, use TAB (or 4 spaces) to indent the line.
3. At the start of a line, use Shift+TAB to un-indent the line.
4. Highlight multiple lines and use TAB or Shift+TAB to adjust the indent for a block of lines.

### Tips

* Laws.Africa will try to indent numbered lists for you, if they aren't indented already.
* Laws.Africa only automatically indents list items that use brackets, such as `(a)` or `(ii)`.
* You must manually indent numbered lists that don't use brackets, such as `2.1` or `3.1.a`, \
  as well as subparagraphs in Schedule paragraphs that have no headings.

## Exercise

Copy and paste the text below into the editor.

```
(3) The municipality may, subject to any law which may be applicable and after obtaining permission of the owner and the occupier of the land concerned, if any—

(a) deviate a watercourse, stream or river if the deviation is necessary for—

(i) the protection of a public road or structure related to a public road; or

(ii) the construction of a structure connected with or belonging to a public road; and

(b) divert storm water from or under a public road onto private property other than land containing buildings, other structures or improvements.
```

1. Click **Update**. The list will be auto-indented.
2. Click **Edit** again. You can see how the edit view reflects the indentation.
3. Change the indenting of `(i)` and `(ii)` to align with `(a)` and `(b)`. (Use Shift+TAB to un-indent.)
4. Click **Update**. All the items in the list are now at the same level.
5. Click **Edit** again, and highlight all the lines.
6. Use Shift+TAB to un-indent all the lines all the way to the left margin.
7. Click **Update**.
8. Laws.Africa indents the list automatically, because it was completely unindented.

## Common pitfalls

Text should not 'break' a list:

!['Provided that …' breaks the (a), (b), (c) list here and implies that subsection (6) is now wrapping up.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1gM4-pB0MOHJcm8D4OtlOHClTL072ejYdTXj3qIT3jw415-ORffZSMSgrCT7lPY7v0DRYqEd4QRpVKsD8sFQEOYDo7i-urgKQyae8\_21hyzqkiu9T-6WfuOn46p5Y8UjT4WWU03A)

Text should never come back out closer to the margin than the text that introduced it:

!['shall be paid …' should line up with 'No amount …' above.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EmQtuqlMnWdcA9a\_4T0XweRG2prrV-VwgEWZQXAsiG2iO40lZp9LwftO5zcK3RpvzSshVTBtK0rjx0ZHDabUGzwnKCLCfIETH0hzSibHGj9U1bWvxzZaGQ80-2mTjBrHdOaHvWIo)
