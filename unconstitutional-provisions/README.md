# Unconstitutional provisions

When a judgment declares (a) provision(s) of a work to be unconstitutional, we can add an enrichment do the document on Indigo to reflect the same.

## Step 1

Open the relevant  imported document on from the work timeline.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 10.26.05.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Open the document and type the word "enrichments" at the end of the url in the address bar.

## Step 2

Highlight the number of the provisions that have been declared unconstitutional by the judgment and click the "Add unconstitutional provision" button in the margin.

If more than one provision has been declared unconstitutional, record them individually, for example paragraphs (b) and (c) in section 6 below. (Selecting both paragraphs in one go would mark the whole section as unconstitutional.)

## Step 3

Fill out the form.

*   the "date deemed unconstitutional" is the judgment date of the judgment making the declaration.&#x20;

*   the "end of suspension period" date is the date by which parliament is instructed in the judgment to have repealed or rectified the unconstitutional provision.

    &#x20;

*   the "judgment  FRBR URI" is the URI of the judgment as seen on the publication website from "/akn..." to before the end on the reference to the language and date.&#x20;



    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 10.58.03.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    In the example above the the judgment FRBR URI is "/akn/tz/judgment/tzca/2025/587"
*   If the entire work has been declared unconstitutional, please check the box. (In this case, you can select any text at the start, it will move to the top of the page once you save.)



    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-30 at 12.08.36.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
* Add text detailing which provisions were declared unconstitutional.&#x20;
  *   example where the provisions declared unconstitutional were added by an amendment.

  * example where the judgment is not available on the publisher website, and could therefore not be linked.
    *   More detailed and includes judgment citation.

## Step 4

Once the unconstitutional provision has been resolved, that is, once it has been repealed or amended:

* Check the "resolved" button to indicate that the issue has been resolved.
* Add the date on which the issue was resolved. This will be the commencement date of the amendment work that resolved the issue.
* Link the amendment work that resolved the issue. (It must already exist on the platform.) This part is a bit slow, try pasting in the title and wait a bit; and make sure the linked work is in the right country by checking the FRBR URI.
