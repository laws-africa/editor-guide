# Example

In Nigeria, section 2 of Act 3 of 2011 ([https://edit.laws.africa/works/ng/act/2011/3/](https://edit.laws.africa/works/ng/act/2011/3/)) reads as follows (I've paraphrased slightly):

> Section 6 of the Constitution is altered in subsection (5) by inserting immediately after the existing paragraph (c) a new paragraph "(cc)"―
>
> > "(cc) the National Industrial Court;".

To make the **amendment**: insert the new paragraph (cc) in section 6(5) of the Constitution, after the existing paragraph (c).

The **annotation** should tell us:

* _what_ the change was: the insertion of a new paragraph (cc)
* _how_ it came about: by section 2 of Act 3 of 2011.

Section 6 of the Constitution as amended would then look something like this:

> **6. Judicial powers**
>
> …
>
> (5) This section relates to—
>
> …
>
> &#x20;       (c)    existing paragraph c;
>
> &#x20;       (cc)  the National Industrial Court;
>
> &#x20;                  _\[paragraph (cc) inserted by section 2 of Act 3 of 2011]_
>
> &#x20;       (d)    existing paragraph d;
>
> …
