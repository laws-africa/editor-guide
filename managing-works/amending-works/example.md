# Example

In Nigeria, section 2 of Act 3 of 2011 \([https://edit.laws.africa/works/ng/act/2011/3/](https://edit.laws.africa/works/ng/act/2011/3/)\) reads as follows \(I've paraphrased slightly\):

> Section 6 of the Constitution is altered in subsection \(5\) by inserting immediately after the existing paragraph \(c\) a new paragraph "\(cc\)"―
>
> > "\(cc\) the National Industrial Court;".

To make the **amendment**: insert the new paragraph \(cc\) in section 6\(5\) of the Constitution, after the existing paragraph \(c\).

The **annotation** should tell us:

* _what_ the change was: the insertion of a new paragraph \(cc\)
* _how_ it came about: by section 2 of Act 3 of 2011.

Section 6 of the Constitution as amended would then look something like this:

> **6. Judicial powers**
>
> …
>
> \(5\) This section relates to—
>
> …
>
>         \(c\)    existing paragraph c;
>
>         \(cc\)  the National Industrial Court;
>
>                    _\[paragraph \(cc\) inserted by section 2 of Act 3 of 2011\]_
>
>         \(d\)    existing paragraph d;
>
> …
