# Consolidating the annotations

When an entire section/Part/Chapter etc is substituted and there are existing annotations in that section/Part/Chapter etc, all of those annotations must be consolidated into one annotation which will appear at the end along with the details of the notice/Act that is doing the substituting.

 The items in the consolidated annotation must be in chronological order.

Once the annotations have been consolidated, the separate annotations must be removed from within that section/Part/Chapter etc. So - a newly substituted section/Part/Chapter etc should only contain one annotation, the one consolidated one at the end.
