# Applying the amendments

For each amendment given in the amending work, make the change indicated. Changes fall into the broad categories of adding text, removing text, replacing text, and amending text.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't include the quotes or any punctuation outside the quotes from the amending work when applying amendments.
{% endhint %}

## Adding text

The text given in the amending work is copied into the existing work where indicated. None of the existing text is changed.

### Example

Amending work:

> 2\. Insert the following section 3A after the existing section 3:
>
> "**3A When to pick strawberries** \
> ****Strawberries may be picked on Tuesdays.".

Amended work before amendment:

> **3 When to pick cucumbers** \
> Cucumbers may be picked on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
>
> **4 When to pick onions** \
> Onions may be picked on Mondays and Tuesdays.

Amended work after amendment:

> **3 When to pick cucumbers** \
> Cucumbers may be picked on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
>
> **3A When to pick strawberries** \
> Strawberries may be picked on Tuesdays.\
> _\[section 3A inserted by section 2 of Act 1 of 2023]_
>
> **4 When to pick onions** \
> Onions may be picked on Mondays and Tuesdays..

{% hint style="info" %}
When a new provision is added, its commencement needs to be recorded separately. See [Working with commencements](../creating-and-editing-works/working-with-commencements.md#insertion-of-new-sections-by-amendment) for how to do this.
{% endhint %}

## Removing text

A provision is removed â€“ anything from as big as a Chapter to as small as a sub-subitem. Leave the number or letter of the provision as, replace headings with `***` and replace the content with an annotation.

### Example

Amending work:

> 6\. Repeal section 12.
>
> 7\. In section 13, delete subsection (1).

Amended work before amendment:

> **12 How to pick apples** \
> ****Apples may only be picked using special apple-picking equipment.
>
> **13 How to pick strawberries** \
> (1) Strawberries may be picked using special strawberry-picking equipment. \
> (2) Strawberries may be picked using a fork.&#x20;

Amended work after amendment:

> **12 \*\*\***\
> ****_\[section 12 repealed by section 6 of Act 1 of 2023]_
>
> **13 How to pick strawberries** \
> (1) _\[subsection (1) repealed by section 7 of Act 1 of 2023]_ \
> (2) Strawberries may be picked using a fork.&#x20;

## Replacing text

The amending work might indicate the changes to be made or give a fresh new provision. Regardless, replace the existing provision with the one given in the amending work.

### Example

Amending work:

> 8\. In section 15: \
> (a) substitute subsection (1) with the following subsection: \
> "(1) Anyone who contravenes section~~\[s]~~ 11~~\[, 12 or 13(a)]~~ will have committed an offence."; and
>
> (b) substitute subsection (2) with the following subsection: \
> "(2) Anyone who has committed an offence may be ~~\[imprisoned]~~ **given a fine**."\
>

> 9\. Substitute section 16 with the following: \
> "**16 Fines** \
> Fines may be from R50.00 to R1000.00, in increments of R50.00, depending on the severity of the offence.".

Amended work before amendment:

> **15 Offences** \
> (1) Anyone who contravenes sections 11, 12 or 13(a) will have committed an offence. \
> (2) Anyone who has committed an offence may be imprisoned.
>
> **16 Imprisonment** \
> Imprisonment may be for 10 days, 20 days or 30 days, depending on the severity of the offence.

Amended work after amendment:

> **15 Offences** \
> (1) Anyone who contravenes section 11 will have committed an offence. \
> &#x20;     _\[subsection (1) substituted by section 8(a) of Act 1 of 2023]_\
> (2) Anyone who has committed an offence may be given a fine.\
> &#x20;     _\[subsection (2) substituted by section 8(b) of Act 1 of 2023]_
>
> **16 Fines** \
> Fines may be from R50.00 to R1000.00, in increments of R50.00, depending on the severity of the offence.\
> _\[section 16 substituted by section 9 of Act 1 of 2023]_

## Amending text

The amending work will give specific instructions as to which words or phrases to add to / delete from / replace in an existing provision. For example:

> Replace the word 'seven' with the phrase 'twenty-one' wherever it appears in section 20.

> Add the following text at the end of the existing subsection (2):

> Delete the proviso to paragraph (c) in subsection (1).

In these cases, follow the instructions and use the verb 'amended' in the annotation.

## Applying multiple amendments at the same point-in-time

If more than one amendment Act/notice has commenced on the same date, they must all be applied in **the same document** at that point in time (see image below as an example)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (210) (1).png>)

When applying these amendments, do them one at a time, in chronological order. Follow the same procedure as for any amendment task, ie:

* apply amendments made by Act 33 of 2008
* submit for review
* make corrections (if there are any)
* submit for review
* reviewer will approve once everything is good
* second reviewer will sign off

Now the amendments made by Act 12 of 2011 can be applied and the same procedure must be followed, once they have been signed off the last amendment (Act 11 of 2017) may be applied.

**NB**: there must only be one document per point in time and the amendments must not be done simultaneously, but one at a time in chronological order as explained above.
