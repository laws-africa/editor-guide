# Creating a new document at the new point in time

{% hint style="warning" %}
Check that the previous document has been **published** before creating a new document, otherwise any errors that still need to be resolved in the previous point in time will be copied into your new document.
{% endhint %}

At the new point in time, click **Create amended version** and select the language.

All this does is create a copy of the document at the previous date, so that the previous version is untouched, or frozen in time at that previous date, so that we can apply any changes to the new copy at the new date.&#x20;

This means that readers of the legislation will be able to compare against previous points in time and see precisely what changed, when, and how.
