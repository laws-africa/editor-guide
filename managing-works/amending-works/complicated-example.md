# Complicated example

**Chapter 6 prior to substitution** - \(_I've deleted all of the text from Chapter 6 and just left the annotations that were in that Chapter prior to it being substituted_.\)

**Chapter 6  
Alert Level 1**

_\[Chapter 6 added by section 4 of Government Notice 999 of 2020\]_

_\[subsection \(8\) amended by section 2\(a\) of Government Notice 1011 of 2020\]_

_\[subsection \(8A\) inserted by section 2\(b\) of Government Notice 1011 of 2020\]_

_\[opening phrase of subsection \(14\) substituted by section 2\(a\) of Government Notice 1053 of 2020\]_

_\[paragraph \(e\) substituted by section 2\(b\) of Government Notice 1053 of 2020\]_

_\[section 75 amended by section 2 of Government Notice 1104 of 2020 and substituted by section 2 of Government Notice 1199 of 2020\]_

_\[section 77 substituted by section 3 of Government Notice 1199 of 2020\]_

_\[subsection \(2\) substituted by section 4 of Government Notice 1199 of 2020\]_

**Chapter 6 being substituted and the annotations consolidated at the end**

This is what the annotation at the end of Chapter 6 will look like after consolidati**on**. There should be no annotations left within the Chapter, just the one at the end. When consolidating an annotation, the items must be listed in chronological order.

\[_Chapter 6 added by section 4 of Government Notice 999 of 2020, amended by section 2\(a\) and \(b\) of Government Notice 1011 of 2020, by section 2\(a\) and \(b\) of Government Notice 1053 of 2020, by section 2 of Government Notice 1104 of 2020, by sections 2, 3 and 4 of Government Notice 1199 of 2020 and substituted by section 3 of Government Notice 1290 of 2020\]_
