# Amending works

There are four parts to applying an amendment:

1. Creating the amending work
2. Linking the amendment
3. Creating a new document at the new point in time
4. Applying the amendments
5. Annotating the amendments.

## Creating the amending work

Amending works are created using the same process as for all other works.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the amending work already exists on the platform, it doesn't need to be created again.
{% endhint %}

{% page-ref page="creating-and-editing-works.md" %}

## Linking the amendment

1. Go to the amended work's page.
2. Click **Manage points in time**.
3. Click **Add amendment**.
4. Search for the title, year or number of the amending work.
5. Select the amending work and click **OK**.

## Creating a new document

At the new point in time, click **Create amended version** and select the language.

## Applying the amendments

For each amendment given in the amending work, make the change indicated. Changes fall into the broad categories of adding text, removing text, replacing text, and amending text.

### Adding text

The text given in the amending work is copied into the existing work where indicated. None of the existing text is changed.

#### Example

Amending work:

> Insert the following section 3A after the existing section 3:
>
> "**3A When to pick strawberries**   
> Strawberries may be picked on Tuesdays.".

Amended work before amendment:

> **3 When to pick cucumbers**   
> Cucumbers may be picked on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
>
> **4 When to pick onions**   
> Onions may be picked on Mondays and Tuesdays.

Amended work after amendment:

> **3 When to pick cucumbers**   
> Cucumbers may be picked on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
>
> **3A When to pick strawberries**   
> Strawberries may be picked on Tuesdays.
>
> **4 When to pick onions**   
> Onions may be picked on Mondays and Tuesdays.

### Removing text

A provision is removed – anything from as big as a Chapter to as small as a sub-subitem. Leave the number or letter of the provision as is and replace the heading or content with `...`.

#### Example

Amending work:

> Repeal section 12.

> In section 13, delete subsection \(1\).

Amended work before amendment:

> **12 How to pick apples**   
> Apples may only be picked using special apple-picking equipment.
>
> **13 How to pick strawberries**   
> \(1\) Strawberries may be picked using special strawberry-picking equipment.   
> \(2\) Strawberries may be picked using a fork.

Amended work after amendment:

> **12 …**
>
> **13 How to pick strawberries**   
> \(1\) …   
> \(2\) Strawberries may be picked using a fork.

### Replacing text

The amending work will sometimes indicate the changes to be made, and will at others give a fresh new provision. Regardless, replace the existing provision with the one given in the amending work.

#### Example

Amending work:

> In section 15:   
> substitute subsection \(1\) with the following subsection:   
> "\(1\) Anyone who contravenes section~~\[s\]~~ 11~~\[, 12 or 13\(a\)\]~~ will have committed an offence."; and
>
> substitute subsection \(2\) with the following subsection:   
> "\(2\) Anyone who has committed an offence may be ~~\[imprisoned\]~~ **given a fine**."

> Substitute section 16 with the following:   
> "**16 Fines**   
> Fines may be from R50.00 to R1000.00, in increments of R50.00, depending on the severity of the offence.".

Amended work before amendment:

> **15 Offences**   
> \(1\) Anyone who contravenes sections 11, 12 or 13\(a\) will have committed an offence.   
> \(2\) Anyone who has committed an offence may be imprisoned.
>
> **16 Imprisonment**   
> Imprisonment may be for 10 days, 20 days or 30 days, depending on the severity of the offence.

Amended work after amendment:

> **15 Offences**   
> \(1\) Anyone who contravenes section 11 will have committed an offence.   
> \(2\) Anyone who has committed an offence may be given a fine.
>
> **16 Fines**   
> Fines may be from R50.00 to R1000.00, in increments of R50.00, depending on the severity of the offence.

### Amending text

The amending work will give specific instructions as to which words or phrases to add to / delete from / replace in an existing provision. For example:

> Replace the word 'seven' with the phrase 'twenty-one' wherever it appears in section 20.

> Add the following text at the end of the existing subsection \(2\):

> Delete the proviso to paragraph \(c\) in subsection \(1\).

## Annotating the amendments

Annotations are how we show readers what happened to a piece of legislation over time. We make an annotation under each change, specifying what the change is and how it came about.

### How to write an annotation

Amendments have four elements:

1. The provision of the amended work
2. The verb associated with the amendment
3. The provision of the amending work
4. The actual change.

Annotations reflect the first three elements in the following way:

```text
{provision of amended work} {verb}ed by {provision} of {amending work}
```

For example:

```text
[[subsection (1) deleted by section 12 of Act 3 of 2019]]
```

or:

```text
[[definition of "consumer" substituted by section 1(a) of the Electricity Supply Amendment By-law, 2017]]
```

### Tips

* Wrap annotations in \[\[double square brackets\]\], because they are editorial remarks.
* Make the annotation as close to the change as possible.
* To determine the verb, follow what is given in the amending work.  \(In Nigeria, 'altered' seems to be preferred over 'amended'.\)
* When annotating a piece of text that is already indented \(like a paragraph\),  use an extra tab for the annotation.
* Don't include the quotes or punctuation outside the quotes from the amending work.
* When the amending work doesn't have an Act number, use its short title.

### Example

In Nigeria, section 2 of Act 3 of 2011 \([https://edit.laws.africa/works/ng/act/2011/3/](https://edit.laws.africa/works/ng/act/2011/3/)\) reads as follows \(I've paraphrased slightly\):

> Section 6 of the Constitution is altered in subsection \(5\) by inserting immediately after the existing paragraph \(c\) a new paragraph "\(cc\)"―
>
> > "\(cc\) the National Industrial Court;".

To make the **amendment**: insert the new paragraph \(cc\) in section 6\(5\) of the Constitution, after the existing paragraph \(c\).

The **annotation** should tell us:

* _what_ the change was: the insertion of a new paragraph \(cc\)
* _how_ it came about: by section 2 of Act 3 of 2011.

Section 6 of the Constitution as amended would then look something like this:

> **6. Judicial powers**
>
> …
>
> \(5\) This section relates to—
>
> …
>
>         \(c\)    existing paragraph c;
>
>         \(cc\)  the National Industrial Court;
>
>                    _\[paragraph \(cc\) inserted by section 2 of Act 3 of 2011\]_
>
>         \(d\)    existing paragraph d;
>
> …

## Exercise

Act 5 of 2012 has the following provisions: 

> 1. In section 1 of the principal Act, delete subsection \(1\).   
> 2. In section 3 of the principal Act, insert the following after paragraph \(a\):   
>     "\(aA\) a new paragraph;"  
> 3. In section 4 of the principal Act, substitute subsection \(2\) with the following:   
>     "\(2\) New subsection."

1. Copy and paste the text below into the editor.
2. Apply the amendments given above.
3. Annotate the amendments.

```text
1. First section of principal Act

(1) First subsection, will be deleted.

(2) This one will be left alone.

2. Second section of principal Act
