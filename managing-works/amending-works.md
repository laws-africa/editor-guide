# Amending works

There are four parts to applying an amendment:

1. Creating the amending work
2. Linking the amendment
3. Creating a new document at the new point in time
4. Applying and annotating the amendments.

## Creating the amending work

Amending works are created using the same process as for all other works.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the amending work already exists on the platform, it doesn't need to be created again.
{% endhint %}

{% page-ref page="creating-and-editing-works.md" %}

## Linking the amendment

1. Go to the amended work's page.
2. Click **Manage points in time**.
3. Click **Add amendment**.
4. Search for the title, year or number of the amending work.
5. Select the amending work and click **OK**.

## Creating a new document

At the new point in time, click **Create amended version** and select the language.

## Applying and annotating the amendments

For each amendment given in the amending work:

* Make the change indicated
* Annotate the change.

Annotations are how we indicate changes to a piece of legislation to readers. We make an annotation under each change \(as close to the change as possible\), specifying what the change is and how it came about.

### Example

In Nigeria, section 2 of Act 3 of 2011 \([https://edit.laws.africa/works/ng/act/2011/3/](https://edit.laws.africa/works/ng/act/2011/3/)\) reads as follows \(I've paraphrased slightly\):

> Section 6 of the Constitution is altered in subsection \(5\) by inserting immediately after the existing paragraph \(c\) a new paragraph "\(cc\)"―
>
> > "\(cc\) the National Industrial Court;".

To make the **amendment**: insert the new paragraph \(cc\) in section 6\(5\) of the Constitution, after the existing paragraph \(c\).

The **annotation** should tell us _what_ the change was and _how_ it came about:   
the insertion of a new paragraph \(cc\) by section 2 of Act 3 of 2011.

Section 6 of the Constitution as amended would then look something like this:

> **6. Judicial powers**
>
> …
>
> \(5\) This section relates to—
>
> …
>
>         \(c\)    existing paragraph c;
>
>         \(cc\)  the National Industrial Court;
>
>                    _\[paragraph \(cc\) inserted by section 2 of Act 3 of 2011\]_
>
>         \(d\)    existing paragraph d;
>
> …

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't include the quotes or punctuation outside the quotes from the amending work.
{% endhint %}

### How to write an annotation

Amendments have four elements:

1. The provision of the amended work
2. The verb associated with the amendment
3. The provision of the amending work
4. The actual change.

Annotations reflect the first three elements in the following way:

```text
{provision of amended work} {verb}ed by {provision} of {amending work}
```

For example:

```text
[[subsection (1) deleted by section 12 of Act 3 of 2019]]
```

or:

```text
[[definition of "consumer" substituted by section 1(a) of the Electricity Supply Amendment By-law, 2017]]
```

### Tips

* Wrap annotations in \[\[double square brackets\]\], because they are editorial remarks.
* To determine the verb, follow what is given in the amending work.  \(In Nigeria, 'altered' seems to be preferred over 'amended'.\)
* When the amending work doesn't have an Act number, use its short title.
* When annotating a piece of text that is already indented \(like a paragraph\),  use an extra tab for the annotation.
* Use `...` where text has been deleted / repealed / removed somehow.
* Don't remove numbering when text has been removed.
* Don't renumber existing provisions unless explicitly instructed to do so by the amending work.
* If explicitly instructed to renumber provisions, make sure to annotate the change.

### Exercise

Act 5 of 2012 has the following provisions: 

> 1. In section 1 of the principal Act, delete subsection \(1\).   
> 2. In section 3 of the principal Act, insert the following after paragraph \(a\):   
>     "\(aA\) a new paragraph;"  
> 3. In section 4 of the principal Act, substitute subsection \(2\) with the following:   
>     "\(2\) New subsection."

1. Copy and paste the text below into the editor.
2. Apply the amendments given above.
3. Annotate the amendments.

```text
1. First section of principal Act

(1) First subsection, will be deleted.

(2) This one will be left alone.

2. Second section of principal Act

This one will be left alone.

3. Third section of principal Act

Introductory text:

(a) first paragraph;

(b) subsequent paragraph; and

(c) final paragraph.

4. Fourth section of principal Act

(1) This one will be left alone.

(2) Old subsection (will be replaced).


```

When you're done, it should look like this in View mode:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

and like this in Edit mode:

```text
1. First section of principal Act

(1) ...

[[subsection (1) deleted by section 1 of Act 5 of 2012]]

(2) This one will be left alone.

2. Second section of principal Act

This one will be left alone.

3. Third section of principal Act

    Introductory text:

    (a) first paragraph;

    (aA) a new paragraph;

        [[paragraph (aA) inserted by section 2 of Act 5 of 2012]]

    (b) subsequent paragraph; and

    (c) final paragraph.

4. Fourth section of principal Act

(1) This one will be left alone.

(2) New subsection.

[[subsection (2) substituted by section 3 of Act 5 of 2012]]


```
