# Amending works

There are four parts to applying an amendment:

1. Creating the amending work
2. Linking the amendment
3. Creating a new document at the new point in time
4. Applying and annotating the amendments to the content.

## Creating the amending work

Amending works are created using the same process as for all other works:

{% page-ref page="creating-and-editing-works.md" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If the amending work already exists on the platform, it doesn't need to be created again.
{% endhint %}

## Linking the amendment

1. Go to the amended work's page.
2. Click **Manage points in time**.
3. Click **Add amendment**.
4. Search for the title, year or number of the amending work.
5. Select the amending work and click **OK**.

## Creating a new document

At the new point in time, click **Create amended version** and select the language.

## Applying the amendment

For each amendment given in the amending work:

* Make the change indicated
* Annotate the change.

### Annotate, you say

Annotations are how we track the changes made to a work; they're like historical signposts.

We make one under each change that was made so that future researchers \(include our future selves\) can validate that amendments were applied correctly and piece together the history of a given piece of legislation.

### Example of an amendment and annotation

The Constitution \(Third Alteration\) Act, 2010 of Nigeria \([https://edit.laws.africa/works/ng/act/2011/3/](https://edit.laws.africa/works/ng/act/2011/3/)\) says in section 2:

> Section 6 of the Principal Act is altered in subsection \(5\) by inserting immediately after the existing paragraph \(_c_\) a new paragraph "\(_cc_\)"â€•
>
> > "\(_cc_\) the National Industrial Court"

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2811%29.png)

The amendment is simple enough: go to section 6 of the Act being amended \(in this case the Constitution\), and in subsection \(5\), after paragraph \(c\), insert the new paragraph \(cc\) that was given in the text of the amending Act.

The annotation should tell us where we can find the amendment: in this case, section 2 of Act 3 of 2011. 

It should also tell us what the change was: in this case, it was the insertion of a new paragraph. 

So under the newly inserted paragraph \(cc\), we'll give the following annotation \(see below for instructions on how to write an annotation\):

> _\[paragraph \(cc\) inserted by section 2 of Act 3 of 2011\]_

### How to write an annotation

Amendments have four elements:

1. The provision of the amending work
2. The provision of the amended work
3. The verb associated with the amendment
4. The actual change.

Annotations reflect the first three elements in the following way:

```text
{provision of amended work} {verb}ed by {provision} of {amending work}
```

For example:

```text
[[subsection (1) substituted by section 12 of Act 3 of 2019]]
```

or:

```text
[[definition of "consumer" substituted by section 1(a) of the Electricity Supply Amendment By-law, 2017]]
```

### Tips

* Wrap annotations in \[\[double square brackets\]\], because they are editorial remarks.
* To determine the verb, follow what is given in the amending work.
* In Nigeria, 'altered' seems to be preferred over 'amended'.
* When annotating a piece of text that is already indented \(like a paragraph\),  use an extra tab for the annotation.
* Use `...` where text has been deleted / repealed / removed somehow.
* Don't remove numbering when text has been removed.
* When an amending work doesn't have an Act number, use the short title.

### Exercise

Act 5 of 2012 has the following provisions: 

> 1. In section 1 of the principal Act, delete subsection \(1\).   
> 2. In section 3 of the principal Act, insert the following after paragraph \(a\):   
>     "\(aA\) a new paragraph;"  
> 3. In section 4 of the principal Act, substitute subsection \(2\) with the following:   
>     "\(2\) New subsection."

1. Copy and paste the text below into the editor.
2. Apply the amendments given above.
3. Annotate the amendments.

```text
1. First section of principal Act

(1) First subsection, will be deleted.

(2) This one will be left alone.

2. Second section of principal Act

This one will be left alone.

3. Third section of principal Act

Introductory text:

(a) first paragraph;

(b) subsequent paragraph; and

(c) final paragraph.

4. Fourth section of principal Act

(1) This one will be left alone.

(2) Old subsection (will be replaced).


```

When you're done, it should look like this in View mode:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

and like this in Edit mode:

```text
1. First section of principal Act

(1) ...

[[subsection (1) deleted by section 1 of Act 5 of 2012]]

(2) This one will be left alone.

2. Second section of principal Act

This one will be left alone.

3. Third section of principal Act

    Introductory text:

    (a) first paragraph;

    (aA) a new paragraph;

        [[paragraph (aA) inserted by section 2 of Act 5 of 2012]]

    (b) subsequent paragraph; and

    (c) final paragraph.

4. Fourth section of principal Act

(1) This one will be left alone.

(2) New subsection.

[[subsection (2) substituted by section 3 of Act 5 of 2012]]


```
