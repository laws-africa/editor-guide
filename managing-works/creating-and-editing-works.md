### Short title

This is the short title of the work, such as "Accountants Act". The official short title of an Act is usually specified in a the Act's "Short title" section. If there isn't one, refer to the contents page of the original publication \(Gazette\). 

{% hint style="info" %}
Short titles normally use Title Case. Don’t use ALL CAPS.
{% endhint %}

### Year of introduction

This is the year in which  the work was first introduced into Parliament or Council.

For example: for "Act 5 of 2012", the year of introduction is 2012.

### Number within year

This is the number of the work within the year of introduction. Together with the year, it uniquely identifies the work.

For example: for "Act 5 of 2012", the number within the year is "5".

#### Numbers for by-laws and other works without numbers

South African by-laws, and other works, sometimes don't have numbers. In this case, use the title of the work, but with the following changes:

* use all lowercase
* replace all spaces with hyphens
* remove references to the name of the municipality or town, since this is already captured
* remove the word "by-law" and phrases such as "relating to"

For example: for the "Cape Town By-law relating to the consumption of Strawberries", the number would be "consumption-of-strawberries".

Yum, strawberries. 🍓

### Work subtype

Leave this blank for Acts. For other types of works, choose an option from the dropdown list. Options depend on the country. Examples include:

* by-law
* legal notice \(ln\)
* statutory instrument \(si\)

### Primary work

Leave this blank for Acts.

For subsidiary legislation and regulations, this indicates the work to which the subsidiary legislation or regulation is related.

To choose a primary work, click Choose primary work and search for the Act in terms of which these regulations have been promulgated.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do not use Primary work to link an amending Act to the Act which it amends. Instead, use the amending Act to create a new point in time for the amended Act. 
{% endhint %}

### Stub

Marking a work as a stub indicates that we will not capture the content of the work, we will only capture the work metadata.

Check the stub checkbox if this is work only amends, commences or repeals another work, and has no substantive provisions of its own.

## Edit the Publication details
