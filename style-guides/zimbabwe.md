# Zimbabwe

## Importing the Word documents

**NB: Use the Word docs to import, but use the pdfs as reference when cleaning up the imports.**

## Annotations

For the existing annotations in the consolidated Acts:

Change "s." or "Section" to "section"

Remove the full stop at the end of the annotation \(if there is one\)

Please do not make any additional changes to the existing annotations, including the annotations in definitions sections.



### Example

\[Section amended by section 4 of Act 22 of 2001.\]  
or  
\[ s. amended by section 4 of Act 22 of 2001.\]  
becomes  
\[section amended by section 4 of Act [22 of 2001](https://edit.laws.africa/works/akn/zw/act/2001/22)\]



## Other changes

### Words incorrectly hyphenated

Look out for random hyphens in words. This is occurring when a word was broken and hyphenated at the end of a line in the pdf, like this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28137%29.png)

These are easier to spot in the pdf as they will always occur at the end of a line.  When you come across them, please delete the hyphen.

### References in Acts

For  references in the Acts, ie:

Please wrap these in `[[double squares]]`.to italicise them.
