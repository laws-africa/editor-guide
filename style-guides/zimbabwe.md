# Zimbabwe

## Importing the Word documents

Import from the Word docs saved here:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1hQubPO35alWRr-xEg\_SAXw\_IX30Tz6qh](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1hQubPO35alWRr-xEg_SAXw_IX30Tz6qh)

Use the Word doc to import, but use the pdf as reference when cleaning up the import. The pdfs are saved in a folder in the same location as the Word docs.

## Annotations

For the existing annotations in the consolidated Acts:

Change "s." or "Section" to "section"

Remove the full stop at the end of the annotation \(if there is one\)

Please do not make any additional changes to the existing annotations other than these.

### Example

\[Section amended by section 4 of Act 22 of 2001.\]  
or  
\[ s. amended by section 4 of Act 22 of 2001.\]  
becomes  
\[section amended by section 4 of Act [22 of 2001](https://edit.laws.africa/works/akn/zw/act/2001/22)\]



## Other changes

For  references in the Acts, ie:

wrap them in `[[double squares]]`.
