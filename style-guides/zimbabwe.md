# Zimbabwe

## Importing the Word documents

Import from the Word docs saved here:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1hQubPO35alWRr-xEg\_SAXw\_IX30Tz6qh](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1hQubPO35alWRr-xEg_SAXw_IX30Tz6qh)

Use the Word doc to import, but use the pdf as reference when cleaning up the import. The pdfs are saved in a folder in the same location as the Word docs.

## Annotations

For the existing annotations in the consolidated Acts:

Change "s." or "Section" to "section"

Remove the full stop at the end of the annotation \(if there is one\)

### Example

\[Section amended by section 4 of Act 22 of 2001.\]  
or  
\[ s. amended by section 4 of Act 22 of 2001.\]  
becomes  
\[section amended by section 4 of Act [22 of 2001](https://edit.laws.africa/works/akn/zw/act/2001/22)\]

Do not make any additional changes to the existing annotations other than these.

## Other changes

For  references in the Acts, ie:

wrap them in `[[double squares]]`.
