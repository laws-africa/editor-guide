* Headings shouldn't end in stops, except in the case of 'etc'.
* Remove the 'History' and the 'Cross-references' at the end of each Act.
* If you come across an 'Explanation', please make a comment and a task from the comment.

## Importing the Word documents

1. Find the **Chapter number** of the Act you're working on. You can do this by looking on the Work overview or by hovering over the Act's title in the task.
2. In Drive, open the relevant folder and download the Word doc with that chapter number. For example, for Chapter 271, I'll open the folder 'Chapters 201 to 300' and download the Word doc called 'chapter 271.docx'.
3. Use this as the document to import.
