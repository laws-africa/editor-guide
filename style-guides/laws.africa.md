# Laws.Africa

## Guiding principles

* User-friendliness.
* Being faithful to the original.
* Accurately capturing the content and structure, and not sweating the presentation.

## What to include and exclude

### Exclude

* Metadata – should be captured separately and reflected automatically on the coverpage:
  * Date of assent
  * Date of commencement
  * List of amendments
* Signatures \(do not include as an image\)
* Arrangement of Sections

### Include

* Language of text signed, e.g. `(English text signed by the Premier)`
* Preface, Long title, Preamble
* Main content
* Schedules

## Headings

Our preferred style is Sentence case for all headings, which is more readable than all caps.

Sentence case capitalises the first word, any proper nouns and acronyms, and defined terms.

* To **capitalise** means to uppercase the first letter:
  * `namibia` → `Namibia`
* **Proper nouns** include country names and the names of certain bodies:
  * `attorney general` → `Attorney General` 
* **Acronyms** \(or [initialisms](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/05/the-difference-between-an-acronym-and-an-initialism/) if you want to be that person\) will often also be defined in the legislation:
  * '"**ITU**" means International Telecommunications Union;'
  * `Members of the itu` → `Members of the ITU`
* But sometimes they'll just be assumed:
  * `The sabc` → `The SABC`
* **Defined terms** are defined in the definitions section of the current work:
  * '"**Board**" means the Board of Commissioners established under section 5 of this Act;'
  * `Members of the board` → `Members of the Board`

{% hint style="info" %}
If a term is consistently used in the upper case in a work, it should be used in the upper case in headings, even if it isn't explicitly defined.
{% endhint %}

## Footnotes

* Use superscript numbering, but not if they go above ⁹. If they go above 9, use \[10\] etc for _all_ footnote numbers \(otherwise we end up with ¹⁰, which doesn't look wonderful\).
* Where possible, give the footnote at the end of the section \(even though it's at the bottom of the page in the original\).
* Don't use a space after the footnote number in the text.
* Do use a space after the number in the footnote.
* If in doubt, follow the punctuation and spacing used in the original.

Here are some numbers to copy / paste: ¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷ ⁸ ⁹

### Example

```text
10. Chocolate pie

(1) All citizens will be given one slice¹ of chocolate pie.

(2) No one has to share their pie with anyone.

¹ A slice should be at least 10cm long and 2cm wide.

11. Rest of Act

…
```

## Forms

* Only use italics for instructions, like \(_insert name here_\).
* Use Crossheadings for headings, including the Form heading. You may end up with 4 or more Crossheadings below each other. It's not great but it can't be helped.
* Use the special character for a checkbox \(☐\) where appropriate.
* Use underscores \(\_\_\_\) for fill-ins.
* Keep the use of images to a bare minimum: only for logos, maps, etc.
* Don't use an image for 'Official stamp' – rather use italics text.
* Don't aim to replicate the formatting exactly as it is in the original; just make sure the text is all there and the meaning is clear.
