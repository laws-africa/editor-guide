# Nigeria

## Cleaning up

### Editorial remarks

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not remove remarks that indicate amendments, such as `[1992 No. 59]`.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/remark-act.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Do use double squares around editorial remarks in Edit mode: `[[1992 No. 59.]]`\
This will show up as italics, single square brackets in View mode: _\[1992 No. 59.]_
{% endhint %}

Remove remarks that reference Caps and Schedules.

### Subsidiary legislation

Remove any subsidiary legislation after the Act, including if it says 'No subsidiary legislation'. Delete the name of the Act as well.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The document should end with the last Schedule to the main Act, or with the last section of the main Act if it has no Schedules.
{% endhint %}

## Use Sections in Schedules

Prefer to use Sections in Schedules rather than Crossheadings.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a title appears to belong to only one numbered Section, mark it as a Section, not as a Crossheading.
{% endhint %}

```
  SEC 1. - Supplementary provisions as to the Corporation

    SUBSEC (1)
