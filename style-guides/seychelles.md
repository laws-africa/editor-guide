## Legislation history

Please include legislation history (shown in the image below) when importing documents in Seychelles. These must be put in a single annotation, with Act references separated by a semi-colon. e.g. `{{*[Act 5 of 1943; Act 5 of 2013; S.I. 7 of 2021]}}`.&#x20;

When a date precedes references with legislation history, please do not include the date in the annotation

## Annotations

Text indicating previous amendments must be an annotation. e.g. `{{*[definition of “Authority” repealed and substituted by s 47(3) of Act 19 of 2013 with effect from 1 March 2014]}}`.

Change "s." or "Section" to "section", "Subsection" to "subsection", "Paragraph" to "paragraph",  "Definition" to "definition",  "Proviso" to "proviso", "Long Title" to "long title", "Heading" to "heading" and "Item" to "item". The only ones that must remain capitalised are "Chapter", "Part" and "Schedule".

Remove the full stop at the end of the annotation (if there is one).
