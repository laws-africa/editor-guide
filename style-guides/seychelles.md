## Legislation history

Please include legislation history (shown in the image below) when importing documents in Seychelles. These must be put in a single annotation, with Act references separated by a semi-colon. e.g. `{{*[Act 5 of 1943; Act 5 of 2013; S.I. 7 of 2021]}}`.&#x20;

## Annotations

Text indicating previous amendments must be an annotation. e.g. `{{*[definition of “Authority” repealed and substituted by s 47(3) of Act 19 of 2013 with effect from 1 March 2014]}}`.

Change "s." or "Section" to "section", "Subsection" to "subsection", "Paragraph" to "paragraph",  "Definition" to "definition",  "Proviso" to "proviso", "Long Title" to "long title", "Heading" to "heading" and "Item" to "item". The only ones that must remain capitalised are "Chapter", "Part" and "Schedule".

Remove the full stop at the end of the annotation (if there is one).

Notes, usually in red, which follow this format "Note: ..." as highlighted in the image below should be marked up as editorial remarks: `{{*[annotation markup]}}`.

If the note has an asterisk, as in the example below, then it should also be marked up as a footnote. An example on how to do this has been added below the image.&#x20;
