# Malawi

## Importing the Word documents

**NB: Use the Word docs to import, but use the pdfs as reference when cleaning up the imports.**

Word docs and pdfs are saved here:

## Cleaning up the import

### Things to look out for that are specific to Malawi

#### Margin references

The references and date that appear alongside/under the Long Title of the Act must be deleted.

The margin references in the pdfs have been moved into the body of the Act in the  Words docs.   
These references must be  in `[[double squares]]`.  
Using the pdf as reference, check that they have been placed correctly by following these instructions:

* if the reference/s appear directly under the section heading in the margin of the pdf they apply to that entire section, so should be positioned right at the end of that section.

* if the reference/s appear alongside a specific subsection, paragraph etc, place them under that subsection, paragraph, etc
