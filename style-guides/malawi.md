In the pdfs, there are references in the margins, ie:

In the Words docs, these references have been moved and should appear directly below the section, subsection or paragraph that they appeared next to in the pdf.   
Using the pdf as reference, please make sure that they have been placed in the correct position.  
Please wrap them in `[[double squares]]`.
