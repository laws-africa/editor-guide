# Malawi

## Importing the Word documents

**NB: Use the Word docs to import, but use the pdfs as reference when cleaning up the imports.**

Word docs and pdfs are saved here:  
[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KJRhHwvRRFvZnQrtwnZonJY8gEJmTJAJ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wbmyN3hXiCkR_F0l7AZDgsI-1oE2lUy4)

## Cleaning up the import

### Things to look out for that are specific to Malawi

#### Margin references

The references and date that appear alongside/under the Long Title of the Act must be deleted.

The margin references in the pdfs have been moved into the body of the Act in the  Word docs.   
These references must be  in `[[double squares]]`and **no changes** must be made to their wording.

Using the pdf as reference, check that they have been placed correctly by following these instructions:

* if the reference/s appear directly under the section heading in the margin of the pdf they apply to that entire section, so should be positioned right at the end of that section.

* if the reference/s appear alongside a specific subsection, paragraph etc, place them under that subsection, paragraph, etc

This is how it will look on the platform, **please take note of how the references are indented**:

## Annotations

For the existing annotations in the consolidated Acts:

Change "s." or "Section" to "section", "Subsection" to "subsection", "Paragraph" to "paragraph",  "Definition" to "definition",  "Proviso" to "proviso", "Long Title" to "long title", "Heading" to "heading" and "Item" to "item". The only ones that must remain capitalised are "Chapter", "Part" and "Schedule".

Remove the full stop at the end of the annotation \(if there is one\)

Please do not make any additional changes to the existing annotations, including the annotations in the definitions.

## Subsidiary legislation

**Subsidiary legislation** which sometimes appears after an Act is not to be included in the import of a document, please remove if it is there.
