# South African Acts

## Short titles

1. Use the short title of the Act as given in its 'Short Title' section.
2. Always include the year of the Act at the end of the title, even if the Short Title of the Act doesn't. For example: 'Western Cape Technical Colleges Law**, 1994**'.

## Regulations

_Do_ keep the introductory text from the notice, but _don't_ treat the Regulations as being in a Schedule.

So, even though the notice text says 'in the Schedule', we put the Regulations in the BODY of the document, and keep the introductory text as the PREFACE of the document. \(Any schedules to the Regulations will be treated as Schedules.\)
