# UNEP

The UNEP project uses a new parser, by which we mean the machine translator that turns the plaintext in the Edit window into rich XML \(see the screenshots below\).

The new parser relies heavily on **indentation** to group content and thus capture the structure of a document.

Keywords introduce a group, and everything that falls into that group is indented below the keyword.

See the 'Marking up' subsections for details, and [Keyword reference](keyword-reference.md) for a summary.
