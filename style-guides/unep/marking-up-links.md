# Marking up links

After working through this section, you should be able to:

* Mark up a link.

The pattern for marking up links is as follows:

* In the text where the link appears, the opening `{{>`
* Immediately afterwards, the URL of the link
* A space, followed by the text that should appear
* The closing `}}`.

### Example

```text
More information at {{>https://laws.africa our website}}.
```

will look like this in View mode:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28110%29.png)

If you click on the linked text \('our website'\), you will be taken to [https://laws.africa](https://laws.africa).

## Exercise

Copy the text below and paste it into a practise document, then see the instructions that follow.

```text
More information at our website.
```

1. Insert the opening `{{>` before 'our website'.
2. Insert the URL `https://laws.africa` immediately after the opening `{{>`, followed by a space.
3. Insert the closing `}}` after 'our website' and before the full stop.

When you're done, it should look like the example above in View mode.

Try clicking on the linked text. Were you directed to [https://laws.africa](https://laws.africa)?
