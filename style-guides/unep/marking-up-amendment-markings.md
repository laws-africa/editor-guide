# Marking up amendment markings

After working through this section, you should be able to:

* Mark up insertions
* Mark up deletions.

## Marking up insertions

The pattern for marking up insertions is as follows:

* Before the inserted text, the opening `{{+`  (note the space after the `+`)
* The inserted text
* The closing `}}`.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the inserted text starts with a space, simply add a second space after the `+`.
{% endhint %}

### Example

```
  All decisions taken should be reported to the Bureau, the {{+ Open-ended}} Working Group and to the next meeting of the Conference of the Parties.

```

Will look like this in View mode:&#x20;

## Marking up deletions

The pattern for marking up deletions is as follows:

* Before the deleted text, the opening `{{-`  (note the space after the `-`)
* The inserted text
* The closing `}}`.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the deleted text starts with a space, simply add a second space after the `-`.
{% endhint %}

### Example

```
  The Secretariat shall {{- consult with}}

```

## Exercise

Copy the text below and paste it into a practise document, then see the instructions that follow.

```
A letter of agreement Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the secretariat of the Basel Convention and the UNEP/OCHA Environmental Unit, identifying the areas and the methodology for cooperation.

```

1. Mark up `letter of agreement` as an insertion.
2. Mark up `Memorandum of Understanding` as a deletion.&#x20;

When you're done, it should look like this in View mode:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (206).png>)

and like this in Edit mode:

```
A {{+ letter of agreement}} {{- Memorandum of Understanding}} has been signed between the secretariat of the Basel Convention and the UNEP/OCHA Environmental Unit, identifying the areas and the methodology for cooperation.

```
