# Marking up images

After working through this section, you should be able to:

* Mark up / insert an image.

The pattern for marking up images is as follows:

* In the text where the link appears, the opening `{{IMG`
* A space, followed by `media/` and the filename of the image
* The closing `}}`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The filename cannot contain spaces.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The image needs to be listed under Attachments on the document.
{% endhint %}

### Example

```
PARA 9. 
  Content of paragraph.
  
  {{IMG media/img4.png}}
  

```

## Shortcut

* In Edit mode, with your cursor placed where the image should appear, click **Insert | Insert image â€¦**
* Choose the image from the existing attachments (or add it to this list if it's not there) and click **Insert image**
* The markup described above will be inserted for you automatically.
