# Marking up Schedules / Annexes

The pattern for Schedules / Annexes is as follows:

* On a new line, the keyword: `ANNEXURE`, `APPENDIX`, `ATTACHMENT`, or `SCHEDULE`
* On the same line, after a space, the name of the element, e.g. `Annex` or `Schedule 1`
* On the next line, optionally, an indent and `SUBHEADING`, followed by a space and the subheading, e.g. `Laws repealed`
* Below the main heading, indented, the content of the Schedule / Annex.

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't use italics or bold markup on any headings, including in Schedules / Annexes.
{% endhint %}
