# Pan-African Parliament/ AGP

## Pan-African Parliament

### Recommendations and Resolutions

#### Preamble and Preface&#x20;

In PAP documents, we use `PREAMBLE` for text like \
"_The Pan-African Parliament,_\
_Recalling X,_\
_Noting of Y, etc."_

We haven't yet found a use for `PREFACE`.

#### Body&#x20;

The `BODY` in Recommendations usually begins as is highlighted in the example below.

The `BODY` in Resolutions usually begins as is highlighted in the example below.

Below are other examples of the `BODY` of Recommendations and Resolutions.&#x20;

#### Documents without a preamble

Sometimes a document will not have a preamble. In such instances, the first keyword used should be `BODY`. Below is an example of one such document.

#### Hierarchical structure

Within the main body and in Schedules, content is often grouped under headings.

In legislation, the most common groupings are Chapters and Parts.&#x20;

For PAP documents, which often don't specify what these headings are called, we use Divisions and Subdivisions.

The most common grouping of content is numbered paragraphs.

#### Keywords most commonly used&#x20;

`DIVISION`

`SUBDIVISION`

`PARA`

`SUBPARA`

### Notes for reviewers

#### Dates

The adoption date of a PAP document (resolution, recommendation or model law) is the last date of the session in which the document was presented.&#x20;

## AGP

### General <a href="#general" id="general"></a>

#### Preface and preamble <a href="#preface-and-preamble" id="preface-and-preamble"></a>

In AGP treaty documents, we use `PREAMBLE` for text like "_The African Union, Recalling X, Noting of Y, etc."_ We haven't yet found a use for `PREFACE`.



In the Preamble of a document, style the first word of each sentence (words highlighted in the image below) as it is in the source document. If such word it **underlined**, please remove the underlining and **add italics** to it.&#x20;

![](../.gitbook/assets/1.png)

#### Body <a href="#body" id="body"></a>

The `BODY` in treaties usually begins **after** the phrase "Have agrees as follows", as is highlighted in the example below.![](https://1576826725-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LoitfV0OP-HrMLMazq\_%2Fuploads%2FMaItnlGMIaUGf46n7Bfc%2Fimage.png?alt=media\&token=b24a6f96-cc48-4bec-b29d-7894883ee60d)

#### Documents without a preamble <a href="#documents-without-a-preamble" id="documents-without-a-preamble"></a>

Sometimes a document will not have a preamble. In such instances, the first keyword used should be `BODY`.

#### Hierarchical structure <a href="#hierarchical-structure" id="hierarchical-structure"></a>

Within the main body and in Schedules, content is often grouped under headings. The most common groupings are Chapters and Parts. For groupings not specified as either a Parts, Chapters or other keyword, we use Divisions and Subdivisions. The most common grouping of content is numbered articles or paragraphs .

#### Keywords most commonly used <a href="#keywords-most-commonly-used" id="keywords-most-commonly-used"></a>

`CHAPTER/ PART`

`ARTICLE`

`PARA`

`SUBPARA`

If a document is divided by headings for which a keyword exists, such as `CHAPTER/PART`, please use `SUBPART`  for any further headings which do not have a keyword.

If a document is divided by headings for which a keyword does  not exist, please use `DIVISION`  and `SUBDIVISION`  for those headings.

#### Things to look out for

**Please** change that appears at the end of a document to sentence case as demonstrated in the example below:



**ADOPTED BY THE TWENTY-THIRD ORDINARY SESSION OF THE ASSEMBLY, HELD IN MALABO, EQUATORIAL GUINEA  27TH JUNE 2014** changes to **:**&#x20;

**Adopted by the twenty-third Ordinary Session of the Assembly, held in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea 27th June 2014**&#x20;



**Please** take out underling in headings
