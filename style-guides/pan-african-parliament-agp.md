# Pan-African Parliament/ AGP

## Pan-African Parliament

### Recommendations and Resolutions

#### Preamble and Preface&#x20;

In PAP documents, we use `PREAMBLE` for text like \
"_The Pan-African Parliament,_\
_Recalling X,_\
_Noting of Y, etc."_

We haven't yet found a use for `PREFACE`.

#### Body&#x20;

The `BODY` in Recommendations usually begins as is highlighted in the example below.

The `BODY` in Resolutions usually begins as is highlighted in the example below.

#### Documents without a preamble

Sometimes a document will not have a preamble. In such instances, the first keyword used should be `BODY`. Below is an example of one such document.

#### Hierarchical structure

Within the main body and in Schedules, content is often grouped under headings.

In legislation, the most common groupings are Chapters and Parts.&#x20;

For PAP documents, which often don't specify what these headings are called, we use Divisions and Subdivisions.

The most common grouping of content is numbered paragraphs.

#### Keywords most commonly used&#x20;

`DIVISION`

`SUBDIVISION`

`PARA`

`SUBPARA`

## AGP

### General <a href="#general" id="general"></a>

#### Preface and preamble <a href="#preface-and-preamble" id="preface-and-preamble"></a>

In AGP treaty documents, we use `PREAMBLE` for text like "_The African Union, Recalling X, Noting of Y, etc."_ We haven't yet found a use for `PREFACE`.



In the Preamble of a document, style the first word of each sentence (words highlighted in the image below) as it is in the source document. If such word it **underlined**, please remove the underlining and **add italics** to it.&#x20;
