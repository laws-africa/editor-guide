# AGP

### General

#### Preface and preamble

In AGP treaty documents, we use `PREAMBLE` for text like \
"_The African Union,_\
_Recalling X,_\
_Noting of Y, etc."_

We haven't yet found a use for `PREFACE`.

#### Body

The `BODY` in treaties  usually begins **after** the phrase "Have agrees as follows", as is highlighted in the example below.

#### Documents without a preamble

Sometimes a document will not have a preamble. In such instances, the first keyword used should be `BODY`.&#x20;

#### Hierarchical structure

Within the main body and in Schedules, content is often grouped under headings.

The most common groupings are Chapters and Parts.&#x20;

For groupings not specified as either a Parts, Chapters or other keyword, we use Divisions and Subdivisions.

The most common grouping of content is numbered articles or paragraphs .

#### Keywords most commonly used

`CHAPTER/ PART`

`ARTICLE`

`PARA`

`SUBPARA`
