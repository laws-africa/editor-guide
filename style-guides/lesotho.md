# Lesotho

## Importing the Word documents

**NB: Use the Word docs to import, but use the pdfs as reference when cleaning up the imports.**

Word docs and pdfs are saved here:

## Cleaning up the import

### Things to look out for that are specific to Lesotho

#### Endnotes

Most of the works in Lesotho contain endnotes which appear at the end of the document. These must be treated as footnotes and styled accordingly.

#### Metadata at the top of Acts

Some of the Lesotho pdfs have this information \[hi-lighted below] at the top of the Act

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (219).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The date underneath the long-title is the date of commencement and must be deleted as it is already captured in the metadata of this work.

The text on the left of the long-title must be retained, please style like this:
