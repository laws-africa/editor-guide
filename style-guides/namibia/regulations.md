**Import documents:**&#x20;

**Word docs:** [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1qo3sbs99zh75BVri3AstNf8Y9NrwrAJT](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1qo3sbs99zh75BVri3AstNf8Y9NrwrAJT)

## Things to look out for

### Before the import

#### Table of Contents

The Word documents have a Table of Contents (ToC) of an "Arrangement of Regulations". This needs to be removed in each document before it can be imported. To remove the ToC:

* find the document you want to import in the ["Import documents" folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1qo3sbs99zh75BVri3AstNf8Y9NrwrAJT)
* open the document in Google docs (before downloading it)
* delete the Toc or Arrangement of Regulations (<mark style="color:red;">text is in red</mark>)&#x20;
* wait for it to save

* close the document

* import the downloaded document
