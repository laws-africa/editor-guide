# UNEP

## Preface and Preamble

In UN documents, we use `PREAMBLE` for text like \
'_The Conference of the Parties,_\
_Recognizing X,_\
_Appreciative of Y, etc_'\
before the first paragraph or heading (see below for an exception).

We haven't yet found a use for `PREFACE`.

See [https://edit.laws.africa/documents/4863/](https://edit.laws.africa/documents/4863/) for an example of a body that doesn't start at a heading or numbered paragraph.

## Hierarchical structure

Within the main body and in Schedules, content is often grouped under headings.

In legislation, the most common groupings are Chapters and Parts.&#x20;

For UN documents, which often don't specify what these headings are called, we use Divisions and Subdivisions.

The most common grouping of content is numbered paragraphs.

### Keywords most commonly used

`DIVISION`

`SUBDIVISION`

`PARA`

`SUBPARA`
