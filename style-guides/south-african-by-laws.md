# South African By-laws

## Short titles

Because by-laws in South Africa are often missing a ‘short title’ section, and because they’re inconsistent with regard to casing, the placement of ‘by-law’, the inclusion of the municipality, etc., we’ve decided to standardise the titles for by-laws in the following ways:

1. Exclude **By-law relating to the** or any part thereof.
   * By-law relating to the Keeping of Dogs → Keeping of Dogs
   * By-law relating to Animals → Animals
2. Exclude **B/by-law/s** at the end of the title.
   * Animal by-law → Animal
   * Guns, Germs and Steel By-laws → Guns, Germs and Steel
3. Exclude **of the XYZ Municipality** or similar.
   * Liquor by-law of the Cape Town Metro Municipality → Liquor
   * Cape Town: Liquor by-law  → Liquor
   * Air Quality By-law of the Swartland Municipality → Air Quality
4. Include e.g. **\(Municipal Council of Piketberg\)** in brackets at the end of the title if this is a more local council / municipality than the \(e.g. District\) Municipality you’re working in.
5. Use lower case for these words: of, and, in, the, for, on.
6. Capitalise the first letter of all other words.
7. For stubs, use the name of the principal work followed by ': Commencement' /  ': Amendment' / ': Repeal' – see [https://edit.laws.africa/places/za-cpt/works/?q=&stub=only](https://edit.laws.africa/places/za-cpt/works/?q=&stub=only) for examples.
