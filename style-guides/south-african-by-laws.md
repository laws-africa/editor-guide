# South African By-laws

## Short titles

Because by-laws in South Africa are often missing a ‘short title’ section, and because they’re inconsistent with regard to casing, the placement of ‘by-law’, the inclusion of the municipality, etc., we’ve decided to standardise the titles for by-laws in the following ways:

1. Exclude **By-law relating to the** or any part thereof.
   * By-law relating to the Keeping of Dogs → Keeping of Dogs
   * By-law relating to Animals → Animals
2. Exclude **B/by-law/s** at the end of the title.
   * Animal by-law → Animal
   * Guns, Germs and Steel By-laws → Guns, Germs and Steel
3. Exclude **of the XYZ Municipality** or similar.
   * Liquor by-law of the Cape Town Metro Municipality → Liquor
   * Cape Town: Liquor by-law  → Liquor
   * Air Quality By-law of the Swartland Municipality → Air Quality
4. Include e.g. **\(Municipal Council of Piketberg\)** in brackets at the end of the title if this is a more local council / municipality than the \(e.g. District\) Municipality you’re working in.
5. Use lower case for these words: of, and, in, the, for, on.
6. Capitalise the first letter of all other words.

### **Example of by-law titles**

* Electricity Supply
* Fire Safety
* Keeping of Bees
* Municipal Planning
* Property Rates
* Rates
* Street Trading
* Tariff

## Capitalising headings

In South African by-laws, we use Sentence case for all headings – never all-caps.

### What is sentence case?

Sentence case capitalises the first word, any proper nouns and acronyms, and defined terms.

* To **capitalise** means to uppercase the first letter,  e.g. `namibia` → `Namibia`
* **Proper nouns** include country names and the names of certain bodies,  e.g. `attorney general` → `Attorney General` 
* **Acronyms** \(or [initialisms](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/05/the-difference-between-an-acronym-and-an-initialism/) if you want to be that person\) will often also be defined in the legislation,  e.g. '"**ITU**" means International Telecommunications Union;'
* **Defined terms** are defined in the definitions section of the current work,  e.g. '"**Board**" means the Board of Commissioners established under section 5 of this Act;'

{% hint style="info" %}
If a term is defined in the lower case, it doesn't need to be capitalised when it appears in a heading.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If a term is consistently used in the upper case in a work, it should be used in the upper case in headings, even if it isn't explicitly defined.
{% endhint %}

### How to fix all-caps headings

1. In View mode, select 'Analysis \| Make section headings Sentence case'.
2. Review and fix section headings.
3. Don't forget Step 2.

### Tips

* Only run 'Make section headings Sentence case' when the headings are all caps.
* Run it as a first step, then check individual headings and re-capitalise proper nouns and acronyms.
* Never run it as a last step.
* 'Quick edit' sections that need words re-capitalised by clicking the pencil next to the heading.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the example above, 'inspector-general of police' should match the casing in subsection \(1\).
{% endhint %}
