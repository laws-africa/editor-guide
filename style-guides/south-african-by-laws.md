# South African By-laws

## Short titles

South African By-laws don't all have 'Short title' sections, and they aren't named consistently when they do have them. This means alphabetical lists of By-laws aren't easy to scan.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, where would you look look for a By-law on air quality in the Swartland municipality? Under **B** for By-law, **S** for Swartland, or **A** for Air Quality?
{% endhint %}

We standardise the titles for By-laws by:

1.  Excluding **By-law relating to the** or similar from the _start_ of the title.

    > By-law relating to the Keeping of Dogs → Keeping of Dogs By-law, 2012
    >
    > By-law relating to Animals → Animals By-law, 2023
2.  Always including or adding **By-law(s), \<year>** at the end of the title — capital B, hyphen, lowercase l — and if they use 'By-laws' with an 's' in the original, keep it.

    > Animal bylaw → Animal By-law, 2012
    >
    > Guns, Germs and Steel By-Laws → Guns, Germs and Steel By-laws, 2023
3.  Excluding **of the XYZ Municipality** or similar.

    > Liquor by-law of the Cape Town Metro Municipality → Liquor By-law, 2020
    >
    > Cape Town: Liquor by-law → Liquor By-law, 2021
    >
    > Air Quality By-law of the Swartland Municipality → Air Quality By-law, 2018
4.  Using **Title Case**: lowercase words like 'of, and, in, the, for, on', and capitalise the rest.

    > Air quality by-law, 2016 -> Air Quality By-law, 2016

> Keeping of Bees By-law: Amendment
>
> Electricity Supply By-law: Repeal

Oddities and edge cases:

*   If the By-law is for a more local council or municipality than say a district municipality we're monitoring, include the name of the more local council in brackets at the end of the title.

    > Keeping of Bees (Municipal Council of Piketberg) By-law, 1998
    >
    > Levying of an Availability Charge for Sewerage (Municipal Council of Velddrif) By-law, 1994
