# Marking up annotations

Annotations, or editorial remarks, are used to indicate that an amendment has been made, or to give any other context to a reader of the legislation. They are marked up to indicate that they are not part of the original or authoritative content of a document.

The pattern for marking up annotations is as follows:

* An opening `{{*[`
* The content of the annotation
* The closing `]}}`.

### Examples

```
SEC 1. - Heading

  Content of section 1.
  
  {{*[section 1 substituted by section 12 of Act 5 of 2021]}}
```
