# Introduction

The Laws.Africa platform uses a parser: a machine translator that turns the plaintext in the Edit window into rich XML (see the screenshots below).

This parser relies heavily on **indentation** to group content and thus capture the structure of a document.

Keywords introduce a group, and everything that falls into that group is indented below the keyword.

See the 'Marking up' subsections for details, and the [Keyword reference](keyword-reference.md) for a summary.
