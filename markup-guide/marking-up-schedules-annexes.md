# Marking up Schedules / Annexes

A schedule comes at the end of a piece of legislation. It is a separate from the main content and has a separate heading, subheading and table of contents.

A schedule has a heading, such as 'Schedule 1', 'First Schedule', or sometimes just 'Schedule'. Some schedules also have a subheading, such as 'Laws Amended'.

The pattern for Schedules / Annexes is as follows:

* On a new line, the keyword: `ANNEXURE`, `APPENDIX`, `ATTACHMENT`, or `SCHEDULE`
* On the same line, after a space, the name of the element, e.g. `Annex` or `Schedule 1`
* On the next line, optionally, an indent and `SUBHEADING`, followed by a space and the subheading, e.g. `Laws repealed`
* Below the main heading, indented, the content of the Schedule / Annex.
