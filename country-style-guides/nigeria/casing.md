## What is sentence case?

Sentence case capitalises the first word, any proper nouns and acronyms, and defined terms.

* To **capitalise** means to uppercase the first letter,  e.g. `namibia` → `Namibia`
* **Proper nouns** include country names and the names of certain bodies,  e.g. `attorney general` → `Attorney General` 
* **Acronyms** \(or [initialisms](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/05/the-difference-between-an-acronym-and-an-initialism/) if you want to be that person\) will often also be defined in the legislation,  e.g. '"**ITU**" means International Telecommunications Union;'
* **Defined terms** are defined in the definitions section of the current work,  e.g. '"**Board**" means the Board of Commissioners established under section 5 of this Act;'

{% hint style="info" %}
If a term is defined in the lower case, it doesn't need to be capitalised when it appears in a heading.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If a term is consistently used in the upper case in a work, it should be used in the upper case in headings, even if it isn't explicitly defined.
{% endhint %}
