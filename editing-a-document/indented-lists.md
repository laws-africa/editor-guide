# Indented lists

Indented lists are used for to capture sub-subsections, sub-paragraphs and other lists that are not modelled as sections or numbered paragraphs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Indented lists are useful for simple numbered lists.
{% endhint %}

## How to indent lists

1. Enter Edit mode
2. At the start of a line, use TAB \(or 4 spaces\) to indent the line.
3. At the start of a line, use Shift+TAB to un-indent the line.
4. Highlight multiple lines and use TAB or Shift+TAB to adjust the indent for a block of lines.

* Laws.Africa will try to indent numbered lists for you, if they aren't indented already.
* Laws.Africa only automatically indents list items that use brackets, such as `(a)` or `(ii)`.
* You must manually indent numbered lists that don't use brackets, such as `2.1` or `3.1.a`,  as well as subparagraphs in Schedule paragraphs that have no headings.

## Exercise

1. Copy and paste the text below into the editor.

```text
(3) The municipality may, subject to any law which may be applicable and after obtaining permission of the owner and the occupier of the land concerned, if any—

(a) deviate a watercourse, stream or river if the deviation is necessary for—

(i) the protection of a public road or structure related to a public road; or

(ii) the construction of a structure connected with or belonging to a public road; and

(b) divert storm water from or under a public road onto private property other than land containing buildings, other structures or improvements.
```

1. Click **Update**. The list will be auto-indented.
2. Click **Edit** again. You can see how the edit view reflects the indentation.
3. Change the indenting of `(i)` and `(ii)` to align with `(a)` and `(b)`. \(Use Shift+TAB to un-indent.\)
4. Click **Update**. All the items in the list are now at the same level.
5. Click **Edit** again, and highlight all the lines.
6. Use Shift+TAB to un-indent all the lines all the way to the left margin.
7. Click **Update**.
8. Laws.Africa indents the list automatically, because it was completely unindented.

## Common pitfalls

Text should not 'break' a list:

![&apos;Provided that &#x2026;&apos; breaks the \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) list here and implies that subsection \(6\) is now wrapping up.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1gM4-pB0MOHJcm8D4OtlOHClTL072ejYdTXj3qIT3jw415-ORffZSMSgrCT7lPY7v0DRYqEd4QRpVKsD8sFQEOYDo7i-urgKQyae8_21hyzqkiu9T-6WfuOn46p5Y8UjT4WWU03A)

Text should never come back out closer to the margin than the text that introduced it:

![&apos;shall be paid &#x2026;&apos; should line up with &apos;No amount &#x2026;&apos; above.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EmQtuqlMnWdcA9a_4T0XweRG2prrV-VwgEWZQXAsiG2iO40lZp9LwftO5zcK3RpvzSshVTBtK0rjx0ZHDabUGzwnKCLCfIETH0hzSibHGj9U1bWvxzZaGQ80-2mTjBrHdOaHvWIo)
