# Chapters and Parts

Chapters and parts are often used to sections. Sometimes a chapter will contain parts, and sometimes parts will contain chapters.

## How to markup chapters

1. Enter Edit mode
2. On one line, start a chapter with `CHAPTER <number> - <heading>`
3. The heading is optional and should use [Sentence case](https://docs.laws.africa/style-guides/south-african-by-laws#what-is-sentence-case), not ALL CAPS.
4. Put the contents of the chapter on the following lines.

**Example**

```text
CHAPTER 2 - Interpretation
```
