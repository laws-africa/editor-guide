# Multiple commencement dates

The automatically generated coverpage of each Act gives the main \(often the only\) commencement date, followed by '**unless otherwise noted**'. So unless we explicitly state otherwise, end users should be able to trust that all the provisions of a given work have been in force since the main commencement date.

Sometimes different provisions of a work commence on different dates, and it's important that we clearly communicate the different provisions and dates to end users.

## How to record multiple commencement dates

1. Get the commencement information \(from the consolidation or gazette/s\).
2. Make an editorial remark at the top of the work:  – give all the commencement dates \(including the main commencement date\)  – give each provision that commenced on each of those dates.
3. At each of the provisions that commenced on a date other than the main commencement date, make an editorial remark that repeats the commencement information for that provision.

{% hint style="info" %}
Include as much information as you have available, including the number and year of the commencement notice.
{% endhint %}
