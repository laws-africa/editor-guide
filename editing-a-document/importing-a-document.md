# Importing a document

## How to import a document as originally published

1. Download the gazetted publication document from the work overview.
2. On the work overview page, click **Manage points in time**.
3. At the initial publication date, click **Import document**.
4. On the new page, choose a language.
5. Choose the file you downloaded in Step 1.
6. Choose the pages to import \(skip the cover page, contents pages and pages containing other laws\).
7. Drag the corners of the blue box to exclude running headers and footers \(but don't exclude any text\).
8. To determine what the section titles look like, scroll sideways until you find a section heading, and choose from the options given at the bottom.
9. Go for it!

Once imported, the document will open and will be ready for clean-up. Compare it to the original and manually correct any OCR or other errors that may have crept in during import.
