# Preface and Preamble

The Preface and Preamble are optional components that come at the start of a piece of legislation, before the main body.

The Preface, if present, always comes before the Preamble.

## How to add a Preface

1. Enter Edit mode.
2. Put the keyword `PREFACE` on a line on its own, before anything else.
3. Place the content of the Preface after the keyword.
4. If there is a Long title, include it in the Preface using the keyword `LONGTITLE`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Preface will appear in the Table of Contents on the left, but it won't have a heading in the document itself. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Preamble will appear in the Table of Contents on the left. In some countries, it may also show up as a heading in the document, depending on the tradition of the country.
